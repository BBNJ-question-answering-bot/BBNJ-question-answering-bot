      "text" : "We propose that there is no definition of ‘strategic environmental assessments (SEA)’ in Part I and we suggest replacing the existing Option A and B for Art 41ter (1) with the proposed drafting. The drafting provides for two categories of SEA under Article 41 ter – a state-led SEA for plans/programmes and a CoP-led process for a ‘regionaltype’ SEA – which captures both interpretations of an SEA that have been supported by other delegations. We are of the view that this is a constructive approach to reach agreement on this issue. There was support from the group that this drafting could be a landing zone for the SEA issue, with some minor amendments, and that not having a definition would be helpful in moving us forward. There were differing views in the group on the obligation placed on State(s) and the COP to conduct these SEAs, and so there remain square bracket options for may/shall/shall consider. The small group did not focus specifically on Art 41 Ter (2) in the current refreshed text, so this proposal does not impact that provision’s placement in the text.\n5/70\nSMALL GROUP ON ARTICLE 4BIS\n(Led by Australia)\nArticle 4 bis\nWithout prejudice\nThis Agreement, including any decision or recommendation of the Conference of the Parties or any of its subsidiary bodies, shall be without prejudice to, and shall not be relied upon as a basis for asserting or denying any claims to, sovereignty, sovereign rights or jurisdiction, including in respect of any disputes relating thereto ."

      "text" : "We propose that there is no definition of ‘strategic environmental assessments (SEA)’ in Part I and we suggest replacing the existing Option A and B for Art 41ter (1) with the proposed drafting. The drafting provides for two categories of SEA under Article 41 ter – a state-led SEA for plans/programmes and a CoP-led process for a ‘regionaltype’ SEA – which captures both interpretations of an SEA that have been supported by other delegations. We are of the view that this is a constructive approach to reach agreement on this issue. There was support from the group that this drafting could be a landing zone for the SEA issue, with some minor amendments, and that not having a definition would be helpful in moving us forward. There were differing views in the group on the obligation placed on State(s) and the COP to conduct these SEAs, and so there remain square bracket options for may/shall/shall consider. The small group did not focus specifically on Art 41 Ter (2) in the current refreshed text, so this proposal does not impact that provision’s placement in the text.\n32/70\nPART V CAPACITY-BUILDING AND TRANSFER OF MARINE\nTECHNOLOGY\n33/70\nSMALL GROUP ON STATES LISTING\n(Led by G77 and China)\nArticle 42\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this Part are to:\n…\n(e) More specifically, support developing States Parties , in particular the\nleast developed countries, landlocked developing countries, geographically disadvantaged States, small island developing States, coastal African States, archipelagic States and developing middle-income countries, taking into account the special circumstances of small island developing States, through capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology under this Agreement in achieving the objectives in relation to:\n…\nArticle 43\nCooperation in capacity-building and transfer of\nmarine technology\n…\n3.

The purpose of the review is to ascertain that the draft proposal contains the information required under article [17 and] 17 bis, including one or more indicative criteria described in this Part and in annex I. The outcome of that review would be made publicly available and shall be conveyed to the proponent by the secretariat. The proponent shall retransmit the proposal to the secretariat, having taken into account the preliminary review by the Scientific and Technical Body. The secretariat shall notify the parties and make that retransmitted proposal publicly available and facilitate consultations pursuant to article 18.\nArticle 18\nConsultations on and assessment of proposals\n…\n5.

Decisions and recommendations adopted by the Conference of the Parties in accordance with this Part shall not undermine the effectiveness of measures adopted in respect of areas within national jurisdiction and shall be made with due regard for the rights and duties of all States in accordance with the Convention. In cases where measures proposed under this Part would affect or could reasonably be expected to affect the superjacent water above the seabed and subsoil of submarine areas over which a coastal State exercises sovereign rights in accordance with the Convention, such measures shall have due regard to the sovereign rights of such coastal States. Consultations shall be undertaken to that end, in accordance with the provisions of this Part.\n7. In cases where an area-based management tool, including a marine protected area, established under this Part subsequently falls, either wholly or in part, within the national jurisdiction of a coastal State, the part within national jurisdiction shall immediately cease to be in force. The part remaining in areas beyond national jurisdiction shall remain in force until the Conference of the Parties, at its next meeting, reviews and decides whether to amend or revoke the area-based management tool, including a marine protected area, as necessary.\n8. An area-based management tool, including a marine protected area, established under this Part shall continue in force when a new regional [agreement] [treaty] body is established with competence to establish an area -based management tool or a marine protected area that overlaps, geographically, with the area -based management tool or marine protected area established under this Part.\n9.

During the period of 120 days provided for in paragraph 3 of this article, any Party may by notification in writing to the Secretariat make an objection with respect to a decision adopted under this part and that decision shall not be binding on that Party. An objection to a decision may be withdrawn at any time by written notification to the Secretariat and thereupon the decision shall be binding for that Party ninety days following the date of the notification stating that the objection is withdrawn.\n5. A Party presenting an objection under paragraph 4 shall provide to the Secretariat in writing, at the time of presenting its objection, the [details] [reason] for its objection, which shall be based on one or more of the following grounds:\n(i) The decision is inconsistent with this Agreement or rights of the objecting\nParty under the Convention [or other relevant rules of international law];\n(ii) The decision unjustifiably discriminates in form or in fact against the\nobjecting Party; or\n(iii) The Party [cannot practicably comply with the decision] after taking all\nreasonable efforts at the time of the objection [The Party has a legal impossibility to comply] [after taking all reasonable efforts].\n6.
