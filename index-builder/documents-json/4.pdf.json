PREAMBULAR ELEMENTS\n• “Desiring by this new instrument to develop an effective regime of conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, including through a fair and equitable regime of access to and sharing of benefits of marine genetic resources. The principle of common heritage of humankind will contribute to the realization of the said objective as, through the application of this principle, the interests and needs of humankind as a whole, especially those of developing countries will be fairly addressed and taken care of.”3\n• Broader contextual issues, e.g. sustainable development, the need for a comprehensive global regime or the link between climate change and oceans.4\n• Recognition of the importance of the ocean towards coping with the ill effects of climate change.5 • Description of the problem and reasons for action; reference to relevant international instruments and bodies such as the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the International Seabed Authority (ISA); and recognition of key concerns and issues such as the importance of marine biodiversity for ocean health, productivity, and resilience, food security, and ecosystem services.6 • Reaffirmation that the conservation of marine biodiversity in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction is a common concern of humankind.7 • Some approaches and principles could also be set out in the preamble of the agreement.8\n3 G77&China 4 EU 5 Federated States of Micronesia 6 USA 7 IUCN 8 New Zealand\nII. GENERAL ELEMENTS\nA. USE OF TERMS9 10 • Definitions should be consistent with those contained in the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS).11 • Definitions, where possible, should be consistent with UNCLOS, UNFSA, and the Convention on\nBiological Diversity (CBD) (including its Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation to the CBD), and other relevant international instruments, adjusted for the marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) context.12\n• \"For the purpose of this Treaty, the following terms shall have the meanings hereunder assigned to them. These definitions are not intended to cover trade in commodities: […]\"13\n1) Areas beyond national jurisdiction\n• Areas beyond national jurisdiction: The high seas are all parts of the sea that are not included in the exclusive economic zone, in the territorial sea or in the internal waters of a State, or in the archipelagic waters of an archipelagic State, according to UNCLOS (article 86). The Area is the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (UNCLOS, article 1).14 • “Areas beyond national jurisdiction” means the high seas and the Area, as defined in UNCLOS.15\n2) Biological diversity\n• “Biological diversity” means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.16\n3) Ecosystem • \"Ecosystem\" means a dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities\nand their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit.17\n9 EU suggested that definitions may be included under the respective parts of an international instrument, unless these terms were to be used in more than one part of the instrument 10 The USA indicated that a section on definitions and scope could include definitions of certain key terms used in the instrument, such as area-based management tools, marine protected areas, and marine genetic resources. It could also describe entities and areas to which the instrument applies. 11 Chair’s understanding on cross-cutting issues 12 Australia 13 Japan 14 CARICOM 15 EU 16 CARICOM 17 CARICOM\n4) Biological resources • \"Biological resources\" includes genetic resources, organisms or parts thereof, populations,\nor any other biotic component of ecosystems with actual or potential use or value for humanity.18\n5) (Marine) genetic resources • \"Genetic resources\" means genetic material of actual or potential value.19 • Marine genetic resources means any marine genetic material of plant, animal, or microbial\norigin of actual or potential value collected from the Area.20 • “Marine genetic resources” means any marine genetic material of plant, animal, microbial or\nother origin, containing functional units of heredity, being of actual or potential value.21 6) Genetic material\n• \"Genetic material\" means any material of plant, animal, microbial or other origin containing functional units of heredity (based on CBD, article 2).22\n• \"Genetic material\" means any material of plant origin, including reproductive and vegetative propagating material, containing functional units of heredity (based on International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), article 2).23\n• “Genetic material: any material of plant, animal, or microbial origin containing functional units of heredity collected from the Area; it does not include materials made from material, such as derivatives, or information describing material, such as genetic sequence data”.24\n7) Derivatives • “Derivative” means a naturally occurring biochemical compound resulting from the genetic\nexpression or metabolism of biological or genetic resources, even if it does not contain functional units of heredity (based on Nagoya Protocol, article 2).25\n8) Utilization of (marine) genetic resources\n• Utilization of genetic resources means to conduct research and development on the genetic and/or biochemical composition of genetic resources, including through the application of biotechnology as defined in article 2 of the CBD.26\n• “Utilization of marine genetic resources” means to conduct commercial research and development on the genetic and/or biochemical composition of genetic resources, including through the application of biotechnology.27\n18 CARICOM 19 CARICOM, Norway 20 Japan, USA 21 IUCN 22 CARICOM, Norway 23 CARICOM, Norway 24 Japan, USA 25 CARICOM 26 Japan 27 Norway\n• “Utilization of marine genetic resources” means to conduct research and development on the genetic and/or biochemical composition of marine genetic resources, including through the application of biotechnology.28\n9) Sustainable use\n• Sustainable use means the use of components of marine biodiversity in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long term decline of biological diversity, thereby maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of present and future generations.29\n10) Bioprospecting30 31\n11) Marine scientific research32 33\n12) In situ collection • “In situ collection” means the collection of marine genetic material in ecosystems and\nnatural habitats in areas beyond national jurisdiction.34\n13) Area-based management tools • Area-based management tools (ABMTs) are tools designed and applicable in a specified area\nlocated beyond national jurisdiction with a view to achieving a defined objective (environmental conservation or/and resource management).35\n• A spatial management tool for a geographically defined area through which one or several sectors/activities are managed with the aim of achieving particular objectives and affording higher protection than the surrounding areas.36\n• ABMTs are regulations of human activity in a specified area, to achieve biodiversity conservation and/or resource management objectives.37\n• Sectoral ABMTs include measures adopted by a competent international organization to achieve biodiversity conservation objectives for a specific area.38 • Cross-sectoral ABMTs, including marine protected areas (MPAs) and marine spatial planning, are those tools that require cooperation and coordination across multiple organizations and bodies, may achieve broader objectives and respond to cumulative impacts.39 • “ABMTs include both sectoral and cross-sectoral measures that contribute to conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity. Examples of cross-sectoral ABMTs include marine\n28 IUCN. IUCN indicates that it believes that for benefit sharing to be meaningful, “genetic and/or biochemical composition” in this definition includes all the data/information described in the chart included in its submission (see section 5.6) as Category I as well as Category II with a periodic review for broadening the category of data/information to be part of benefit sharing. 29 CARICOM 30 CARICOM 31 Japan suggested that bioprospecting should not be defined in an international instrument. 32 CARICOM 33 Japan suggested that marine scientific research should not be defined in an international instrument. 34 Norway 35 G77&China 36 EU 37 Monaco 38 Monaco 39 Monaco\nspatial planning and marine protected areas. Examples of sectoral ABMTs include fisheries closures designated by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSAs) designated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), or Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEIs/reference zones) designated by the International Seabed Authority (ISA).”40\n• Definitions of AMBTs might differ between existing instruments governing existing oceans management mechanisms, such as IMO, RFMO/As, regional seas conventions and ISA. However, there are also commonalities. Important to focus on the functions of ABMTs when deciding whether and how to define them. Need to be clear on what we want to achieve by defining these concepts and what will be the practical usage and implications of the definitions.41\n14) Marine Protected Areas\n• Definition of marine protected areas could distinguish them as a subcategory of ABMTs which have a primary stated objective of achieving long-term conservation of marine biodiversity and ecosystems.42\n• “A geographically defined area which is designated, regulated and managed to achieve specific conservation objectives” (CBD).43\n• The definition of MPAs in the implementing agreement should include at least a geographical notion, a function and a conservation objective. The definition of “protected area” provided in article 2 of the CBD can be a starting point which would need to be adapted, as appropriate, in order to specifically focus on marine areas beyond national jurisdiction.44 • The CBD defines a protected area as: \"A geographically defined area which is designated, regulated and managed to achieve specific conservation objectives.\" This definition can be a good starting point for drafting the concept of area based measures to protect and manage biodiversity in the high seas. Any definition of an MPA in the future instrument must be wide or flexible enough to encompass the high seas protected areas already created by RFMOs, so that they are fully recognised as MPAs under the instrument.45 • On the basis of the definition in Article 2 of the CBD, an MPA is a geographically defined marine area which is designated and regulated and managed to achieve specific conservation objectives.46\n• The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) considers an MPA \"any marine geographical area that is afforded greater protection than the surrounding waters for biodiversity conservation or fisheries management purposes.\" Thus, MPAs should not be limited to \"marine reserved areas\" or \"no take zones.\" The definition of MPAs in the new implementing agreement should clearly reflect these points.47\n40 WWF 41 Norway 42 New Zealand 43 G77&China 44 Monaco 45 Iceland 46 EU 47 Japan\n• The definition of MPAs could be based on the IUCN definition and should be broad enough to include different types of protected areas including no-take marine reserves. “A designated geographically defined marine area [in areas beyond national jurisdiction] where human activities are regulated, managed or prohibited in order to achieve specific conservation objectives including the long-term conservation and resilience of nature.”48 • Marine protected area: “A geographically defined area, in which human activities are regulated, managed or prohibited in order to achieve specific conservation objectives, including the long-term conservation of nature.”49 • Marine protected area means: “A defined area of the marine environment, including its associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by legislation or other effective means, including custom, with the effect that its marine biodiversity enjoys a higher level of protection than its surroundings”. Besides the definition, the IUCN categorization of different types of (marine) protected areas should be recognized to guide the designation process and the development of appropriate management plans. As guidance may change over time in light of new scientific information, it is suggested that such guidance be included in an Annex to the implementing agreement that enables eventual amendments to be incorporated by decisions of a Conference of the Parties (COP).50\n15) Marine reserves51 • As long as the definition of MPAs under the new agreement clearly includes the option of\nareas where extractive and damaging human activities are prohibited (i.e. marine reserves), there is no specific need to have a separate legal definition of marine reserves.52\n16) Marine spatial planning\n• Marine spatial planning is a cross-sectoral area-based management tool that provides a framework for the orderly and sustainable use of the oceans as envisioned by UNCLOS with a view to balance demands for development with the need to protect the marine environment. Sectoral area-based management tools (e.g. fisheries closures, Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSAs), Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (APEIs)), other cross-sectoral ABMTs (e.g. MPAs), strategic environmental assessments (SEAs) and environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are an integral part of this overarching planning approach. Marine spatial planning approaches should be ecosystem-based, adaptive and include all relevant stakeholders in the area under consideration.53\n17) Ecosystem-based management\n• “Ecosystem-based management” means an integrated approach to management that considers the entire ecosystem, including all stakeholders and their activities, and resulting stressors and pressures with direct or indirect effects on the ecosystem under consideration.\n48 Greenpeace 49 High Seas Alliance 50 WWF 51 Greenpeace 52 Greenpeace 53 WWF\nThe goal of ecosystem-based management is to maintain or rebuild an ecosystem to a healthy, productive and resilient condition, through, inter alia, the development and implementation of cross-sectoral ecosystem-level management plans”.54\n18) Environmental impact assessments\n• A process to evaluate the environmental impacts of activity to be carried out in areas beyond national jurisdiction, with an effect on areas within or beyond national jurisdiction, taking into account interrelated socioeconomic, cultural and human health impacts, both beneficial and adverse.55\n19) Transboundary environmental assessment56 57 20) Technology\n• Technology should not just refer to hard technology but also to all of its associated aspects - article 5(8), Annex III to UNCLOS refers technology to also mean “specialized equipment and technical know-how, including manuals, designs, operating instructions, training and technical advice and assistance, necessary to assemble, maintain and operate a viable system and the legal right to use these items for that purpose on a non-exclusive basis” - therefore encompassing the entire technological system as a whole. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development draft International Code on the Transfer of Technology also supports this view by defining technology transfer more holistically. Article 22, paragraph 5(g), of the Nagoya Protocol additionally calls for infrastructure and enhancing technical capacity to make such transfer sustainable.58\n21) Biotechnology • “Biotechnology” means any technological application that uses marine biological systems,\nliving organisms or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use.59\n22) Transfer of marine technology • The transfer of marine technology refers to the transfer of instruments, equipment, vessels,\nprocesses and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the oceans.60\n54 WWF 55 G77&China 56 CARICOM. 57 New Zealand indicated that it was not convinced at this stage that it is necessary to specifically define a transboundary EIA. 58 AOSIS 59 Norway 60 AOSIS\nB.

Incorporation of other concepts could be addressed in the context of a preamble, which accords with principles of treaty interpretation.84\n• The purpose of the implementing agreement should be \"the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ.\" The purpose of the implementing agreement should be considered in reference to the following provision:\no Article 2 of UNFSA: \"The objective of this Agreement is to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks through effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention\".85\n• Drawing on UNFSA article 2, the overall objective of the agreement could be phrased as follows: o “The objective of this Agreement is to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable\nuse of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction through effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention”. 86\n• A possible overall objective could be: o “To ensure the long term conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond\nnational jurisdiction through effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention.”87\n• “The objective of this Agreement to be pursued in accordance with its provisions is to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction through the effective operationalization of ecosystem-based integrated oceans management and through the effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention and other relevant instruments.”88 • Ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.89\n• Conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction to ensure its long-term sustainability for the benefit of the humankind.90\n• Ensure the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction in compliance with the purpose and objectives of UNCLOS.91 • Restatement of the objective of UNCLOS to protect and preserve the marine environment.92 • Furthering of regional cooperation and regional cooperative mechanisms, since this will be the\nmain vehicle for ensuring long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity.93\n84 Australia 85 Japan 86 Norway 87 New Zealand. New Zealand indicated that it also supports supplementary objectives for each of the four main aspects of the implementing agreement (i.e. marine genetic resources and the sharing of benefits; area-based management including marine protected areas; environmental impact assessments; and capacity building and transfer of marine technology). 88 WWF 89 Monaco 90 Fiji 91 CARICOM 92 CARICOM 93 Norway\n• With respect to utilisation of biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, States should take measures to prevent or eliminate excess capacity and should ensure that levels of effort by entities involved are commensurate with the sustainable use of biological diversity as a means of ensuring the effectiveness of conservation and sustainable management measures.94\nD. RELATIONSHIP TO UNCLOS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\n• The instrument should not undermine existing relevant legal instruments and frameworks and\nrelevant global, regional and sectoral bodies.95 • Guidance can be drawn from existing instruments, in particular UNFSA, when addressing the\nrelationship of the instrument with UNCLOS.96 • Provision analogous to that of article 4 of UNFSA providing that nothing in the agreement shall\naffect the rights, obligations or jurisdiction of States under the Convention.

Accordingly, a without-prejudice-clause would assist in achieving this purpose.107 • There is value in global standard-setting, via the implementing agreement, that catalyses Parties to act at a regional level without undermining existing regional and sectoral efforts, and in keeping with resolution 69/292.108 • The implementing agreement and its provisions should not undermine existing relevant instruments, frameworks, processes, and relevant international, regional and sectoral bodies nor duplicate and dictate measures to such existing bodies.109 • The meaning of paragraph 3 of resolution 69/292 is that the process should not undermine, or reduce, the effectiveness of existing relevant legal instruments and frameworks and relevant global, regional and sectoral bodies.110\n• Consider including a provision in the implementing agreement stating explicitly that the implementing agreement should not affect the competence of mechanisms managing activities such as shipping and fisheries:\no The Agreement shall not affect the competence of relevant international organisations and arrangements within their areas of competence.111\n• Consider including in the implementing agreement provisions stating explicitly what role or function the implementing agreement should not have in relation to activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The role of the implementing agreement would rather be to contribute to a holistic, ecosystem based and cross sectoral approach to oceans management through common guidelines and strengthened coordination and cooperation. The OSPAR Convention provides an example of such an approach. Annex V to the OSPAR Convention spells out OSPAR’s general biodiversity responsibility, while article 4 explicitly states that OSPAR will not deal with direct management of fisheries and not manage shipping.112\n104 Fiji 105 USA 106 USA 107 EU 108 Australia 109 Monaco 110 High Seas Alliance 111 Norway 112 Norway"

GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND APPROACHES113\n• A distinction should be drawn between principles and approaches.114 • Draw on article 5 of the UNFSA as a starting point.115 • Some of the principles and approaches relate to governance and process issues, e.g.\naccountability and transparency, and others relate to the manner in which marine biodiversity should be conserved and sustainably used under the new agreement, reflecting international best practice, e.g. precautionary approach, ecosystem approach, decisions based on best available scientific information.

Possible elements for text could be:\no “In implementing the Agreement, States Parties shall work together to actively engage competent international organisations and arrangements to take actions within their competence to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of this Agreement. Where a State Party considers that action is desirable in relation to a question falling within the competence of relevant international organisations or arrangements, it shall draw that question to the attention of the organisations or arrangement competent for that question. The Parties who are members of the organisation or arrangement in question shall cooperate within that organisation or arrangement in order to achieve an appropriate response.” 179\n• Encourage and strengthen cooperation and coordination between competent mechanisms. Article 8.6 of UNFSA is a relevant example to consider in this regard:\no Any State proposing that action be taken by an intergovernmental organization having competence with respect to marine biodiversity shall, where such action could have a significant effect on conservation and management measures already established by a competent sectoral or regional organisation or arrangement, consult through that organisation or arrangement with its members or participants. To the extent practicable, such consultation should take place prior to the submission of the proposal to the intergovernmental organisation.180\n• Create an incentive for existing organizations to improve their performance, and where necessary, expand their mandates, through their implementation of the global standards and guidelines reflected in the implementing agreement (article 13 UNFSA refers).181 • Where there is no body with a mandate for the conservation or sustainable use of marine biodiversity in a particular sector or geographic area of areas beyond national jurisdiction, or in\n175 New Zealand 176 New Zealand 177 Norway 178 Iceland 179 Norway 180 Norway 181 New Zealand\ncases where there are a number of bodies but no effective coordination mechanism, encourage the establishment of a relevant body or effective coordination mechanism within a specific timeframe (article 8(5) UNFSA refers).182\n• States, in possessing the freedoms entailed under the Convention, should collaborate with a view to establishing regional organizations, or a council of organizations, with a mandate to administer and coordinate the various activities to ensure conservation and sustainable use.183\n• Where any interest or activity exists, States Parties, particularly adjacent States, should cooperate to ensure effective conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. This should be achieved, where appropriate, through the establishment of a subregional or regional organization or arrangement.184\n• A subregional or regional organization or arrangement should include representatives of States in whose jurisdictions the biological resources in areas under the agreement are adjacent to.185\n• Where a subregional or regional organization or arrangement exists and has the competence to establish conservation and sustainable use measures, States Parties to the agreement, should be required to become a member of such organization in order to effectively cooperate in such organization or arrangement, and actively participate in its work.186 • A State Party which is not a member of a subregional or regional organization or arrangement or is not a participant in a subregional or regional organization or arrangement should nevertheless cooperate, in accordance with relevant international agreements and international law, in the conservation and management of the relevant fisheries resources by giving effect to any conservation and management measures adopted by such organization or arrangement.187\n• The new agreement should help enhance collaboration and, in some ways, also accountability of regional and sectoral bodies, in line with modern principles of good governance. The new agreement cannot impose measures on other bodies or non-Parties. Ultimately however, regional and global bodies are made of Member States, some of which will be Parties to the new agreement and bound by it, and others will be non-Parties. The latter are obliged under international law to cooperate in good faith for the protection and preservation of the marine environment, and therefore to ensure that their activities do not undermine the effectiveness of the new agreement’s conservation measures.188\nC.

On the other hand, the future instrument should cover fish and other biological resources used for the research on their genetic properties.193 • A distinction should be made between the use of fish for their genetic properties, and the use of fish as a commodity. The former could be addressed in the same manner as other marine genetic resources under any new BBNJ agreement, while the latter is already effectively managed under existing regimes, such as RFMOs, and should not be considered marine genetic resources for the purposes of this new agreement.194\n• Apply only to marine genetic resources used for their genetic properties, and not to organisms when used as a commodity.195\n• A distinction should be made between fish used as a commodity and fish valued for their genetic properties.196\n• Fish as part of marine biodiversity is relevant to an international legally binding instrument to the extent necessary to extract genetic resources; however, due care must be exercised to ensure that an international legally binding instrument does not undermine existing fishery regulations, such as measures implemented by RFMOs.197\n• Decisions will need to be made whether it is practicable and/or desirable to draw distinctions between benthic formations and organisms in the Area and fishes swimming in the high seas.198\n• The BBNJ instrument should cover both in situ marine genetic resources and ex situ samples of marine genetic resources.199 • Marine genetic resources could include both those that are in situ and ex situ. Including ex situ samples could be included in addition to in situ samples. An implementing agreement could include a requirement for a set of procedures to be established for collection, transportation and storage (or a minimum metadata i.e. collection location, depth, temperature, etc.) which will promote a global standardization of procedures that would benefit all for a better global coordination, cooperation and collaboration.200 • Fruitless given the sphere of the unknown that the new instrument employ the approach of listing particular marine genetic resources that would be covered by its provisions.

Given its crosscutting nature, the principle should be at the core of the new instrument. The principle of the common heritage of mankind provides the legal foundation for a fair and equitable regime of conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, including the access and sharing of benefit of marine genetic resources. Among the elements of the principle of common heritage of mankind that are critical to a fair and equitable regime for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity, of which marine genetic resources are part, include the following:\no since the objective of the new instrument is to conserve and sustainably use marine biological diversity, this implies the need to carry out activities pertaining to that objective for the benefit of mankind as a whole, irrespective of their geographical location, and taking into particular consideration the interests and needs of the developing countries (regardless of sub-categorization of countries under ‘developing countries’); o no claim or exercise of sovereignty or sovereign rights of the areas beyond national jurisdiction nor any appropriation shall be recognized; o use of areas beyond national jurisdiction and their resources by all States shall be exclusively for peaceful purposes; o the benefits shall be equitably shared; o in addition, this implies that the activities regarding the exploration, exploitation of the\nresources in the said areas should be governed by an international regime.205 • Marine genetic resources whether in the Area or in the water column beyond the exclusive\neconomic zone are subject to certain core principles that form the basis of the common heritage of mankind concept as reflected in customary international law, requiring:\no peaceful use; o non-appropriation;\n201 Jamaica 202 Federated States of Micronesia 203 Chair’s understanding on marine genetic resources, including questions on the sharing of benefits 204 Chair’s understanding on marine genetic resources, including questions on the sharing of benefits 205 G77&China\no an international regime to govern the management and conservation of resources for future generations and an equitable sharing of benefits.206\n• The common heritage of mankind principle of article 136 of UNCLOS, applies to mineral resources, at or beneath the sea-bed, as defined in article 133, and is not applicable to renewable, biological resources on the seabed or in the water column beyond national jurisdictions. The principle of the freedom of the high seas which is enshrined in article 87 of UNCLOS seems more suitable in regard to marine genetic resources. Given that neither of the aforementioned principles seem to be directly applicable, a practical, possibly hybrid, definition and solution needs to be found.207\n• The principle of freedom of the high seas should be applied to marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction. An implementing agreement must include a clear provision to this effect, to the extent that the views are expressed that the principle of common heritage of mankind should apply to marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction in the new implementing agreement. No inclusion of provisions in the new implementing agreement which could be interpreted as meaning that marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction are recognized as common heritage of mankind.208\n• Principle of adjacency in the sense that high sea pockets created by adjacent exclusive economic zones deserve special attention. Coastal States have greater opportunity, and should be allowed greater role, in conserving, managing, and regulating access to the resources of those high sea pocket areas.209 • A new regime should ensure: o legal certainty, clarity and transparency; o free access and encouragement of research, innovation and commercial development; o sustainable collection of genetic material; o environmentally sound techniques and methods of operation; o a general duty of care; o fair and non-arbitrary rules and procedures for benefit sharing; o simple, expedient and cost-effective procedures and mechanisms.210\n• Common concern of humankind is a principle that could be applied to access and benefit sharing of marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction since the focus of an implementing agreement is on the sustainable use of the marine genetic resources and utilization of the shared benefits for conservation of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.211"

Exploitation of marine genetic resources poses environmental threats and many of these threats are not fully understood with present technology. The interests of fairness and equity lean heavily towards sharing of the benefits from access to marine genetic resources in light of mutual risks from the environmental and ecological hazards arising from the exploitation of these resources.214\n• A regime for access and benefit-sharing could include the following elements: o ensure free access to genetic material from areas beyond national jurisdiction; o obligations for flag States to carry out the collection of marine genetic resources in a\nway that does not harm the ecosystem and to use environmentally sound techniques and methods of operation;\no in marine protected areas environmental protection measures may be stricter if needed; o establish an access and benefit-sharing clearing house modelled on the Nagoya Protocol\narticle 14; o include an obligation for the flag State to report on accessed marine genetic resources\nfrom areas beyond national jurisdiction to the clearing house after the material has been deposited. A sample could also be provided to a public collection;\no establish research programmes on marine research that can support the conservation and management of areas beyond national jurisdiction with the participation of developing countries inspired by article 16 of the ITPGRFA.

Bearing in mind that any access within the scope of the new instrument will not hamper marine scientific research, there is interest to include a provision on access to marine genetic resources.217\n• In situ access to marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction should be based on, in particular, the following principles:\no access to marine genetic resources should remain free, in line with UNCLOS provisions concerning marine scientific research in areas beyond national jurisdiction; o the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, in line with applicable UNCLOS provisions; o rights and obligations of coastal States over the resources in the maritime zones within their jurisdiction, as provided for in UNCLOS, should be respected.218\n• The relationship between Part XIII of UNCLOS, which covers the freedom of marine scientific research, and a scheme governing the extraction of marine genetic resources will need to be considered and addressed by the Prep Com. Ensure the UNCLOS regime for marine scientific research is respected and upheld for the extraction of marine genetic resources, whilst a fair and equitable regime is established for the sharing of benefits from the use of marine genetic resources sourced from areas beyond national jurisdiction.219\n• This section could set out guidance for utilization of marine genetic resources from areas beyond national jurisdiction. It would reaffirm that the instrument would not hinder access to marine genetic resources or research and development.220\n• Draw from the principles contained in the Nagoya Protocol with respect to knowledge associated with genetic resources and \"prior consent\" involving indigenous and local communities.221\n• The issue of whether a version of prior informed consent and mutually agreed terms will appear in the new instrument is to be considered in the context of how these elements form the basis of access under the Nagoya Protocol.222\n• Ensure free access to genetic material from areas beyond national jurisdiction. Favour a “light” access regime. This could for instance be done by establishing a clearing house for marine genetic resources which could be integrated in DOALOS. Such a regime could include an obligation on the flag State to register information on accessed genetic material with the clearing house which in turn would make the information publicly available. A fully-fledged access-regime with applications, permits and contracts by \"a marine genetic resources steward of the areas beyond national jurisdiction\" on the one hand and the flag State on the other, similar to the regime for mineral resources in the Area, will be costly and cumbersome. It would potentially hinder research and development and thereby also conservation. As opposed to harvest of commodities, utilisation of genetic material does, as a rule, depend on only small amounts of biological material. This is mostly unproblematic in terms of in situ conservation of\n217 G77&China 218 EU 219 Australia 220 USA 221 Federated States of Micronesia 222 Jamaica\nbiological material as long as the collection is made with due care to the environment and with the use of environmentally sound techniques and methods of operation. Thus, one does not need a strict regime for access to marine genetic resources subject to prior informed consent in order to prevent environmental degradation of ecosystems. Overview and control and tracking of the utilisation of the marine genetic resources in order to share the benefits of the utilisation should be pursued by other mechanisms than a permit system.223\n• Specific obligations on capacity building and transfer of marine technology can be built into the conditions for access. This example is drawn from the ISA model whereby provisions on capacity building are included as conditions for the issuance of exploration licenses.224\n• To promote the involvement of users from developing countries, access to marine genetic resources from areas beyond national jurisdiction could come with the condition of making the material and/or genetic information publicly available in open source databases, biorepositories and/or biobanks, thus contributing to the already existing common pools of genetic resources.225"

Non-\nmonetary benefits therefore seem more appropriate in this regard.242 • Primarily concentrate on non-monetary benefits. The point of departure with regard to types of\nnon-monetary benefit sharing are provisions contained in Part XIII (‘Marine Scientific Research’) and Part XIV UNCLOS (‘Development and Transfer of Marine Technology’). Also draw on the indicative list of non-monetary benefits provided for in the Nagoya Protocol.243\n• UNCLOS provisions related to marine scientific research already foresee different forms of nonmonetary benefit-sharing, such as:\no promoting international cooperation in marine scientific research (article 242 UNCLOS); o making knowledge resulting from marine scientific research available by publication and\ndissemination (article 244 para. 1 UNCLOS); o promoting data and information flow and the transfer of knowledge (article 244 para. 2\nUNCLOS). In this regard the new UNCLOS implementing agreement could provide for a framework to specify, coordinate, promote and monitor the implementation, with respect to marine genetic resources from areas beyond national jurisdiction, of the above mentioned benefit-sharing provisions to make the best use of the available diverse non-monetary benefit-sharing activities. Such an approach could be further strengthened and integrated with capacity-building activities that could be based on Part XIV UNCLOS, as well as with activities to enhance, facilitate and stimulate the sharing of material, information and knowledge. In particular, it could be useful to draw upon such provisions of Part XIV UNCLOS as articles 266 (‘promotion of the development and transfer of marine technology’) and 269 (establishment of, inter alia, programmes of technical cooperation, seminars, conferences, promote the exchange of scientists).244 • The annex to the Nagoya Protocol provides useful advice on potential non-monetary benefits.245 • The non-monetary benefit should comprise of access to all forms of resources, data and related\nknowledge, transfer of technology and capacity building as well as facilitation of marine scientific research on marine genetic resources of areas beyond national jurisdiction.246\n• Some of the non-monetary benefits that are of particular importance are: o the transfer of technology and dissemination of scientific knowledge and research and\ndevelopment results relating to marine genetic resources; o strengthening the research capabilities of developing countries through education and\ntraining; and o collaboration in research and development programs where possible.247\n• Non-monetary benefits may include: o access to samples, data and knowledge, including the publication and sharing of\nscientific knowledge;"

The value of collection and sharing of data and knowledge on the associated marine environment, biodiversity and ecosystems could also be recognised and such practices encouraged.250\n• Consider the particular types of benefits that can be shared at particular points in the process. For example, an access and benefit sharing regime under the implementing agreement may require marine genetic resources research to be published within a specified reasonable timeframe, ensuring that findings are shared with the international community. This could provide value, even in instances where commercialisation is delayed, or does not eventuate.251 • Establish a hybrid mechanism to bring the best elements of all existing instruments into a functional whole. It could integrate capacity building measures in the benefit-sharing mechanism, by implementing part XIV of UNCLOS and in particular its article 266, on the promotion of the development and transfer of marine technology. One possibility to consider could be to establish international programmes on marine research to support the conservation and management of the marine environment in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Inspired by the ITPGRFA, Part V Supporting components, the research programmes should include provisions on the participation of developing countries. The programmes could be linked to existing national research institutions and have research activities on genetic material from areas beyond national jurisdiction which may in turn generate monetary benefits for the participants. Another possibility would be to include in the IA provisions obliging developed parties to include developing partners in their research and exploration activities on marine genetic resources.252"

The general purpose of the fund can be outlined in an international legally binding instrument, whereas detailed mechanics of uses can be provided by protocol.257\n• Benefits, including monetary benefits, could be allocated to a fund for capacity building, including training, and technology transfer. The specific allocation could ensure that the benefits are used for conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction.258\n• Based on the example of the ITPGRFA, in which recipients in developing countries and countries with economies in transition are exempt from certain payments, consideration should be given to whether similar special exemptions should be extended to developing and least developed countries where there are obligations to pay into a benefit-sharing fund.259 • Establish a system similar to the annual partnership contribution under World Health Organization Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework for the Sharing of Influenza Viruses and Access to Vaccines and Other Benefits.260 • To distribute benefits fairly and equitably, include, or combine: a project-based approach similar to the ITPGR Benefit-sharing Fund: following the announcement of a call for project proposals, these are received by the Secretariat and screened by a panel of experts according to specific eligibility and selection criteria which were adopted by the ITPGRFA Governing Body. The new implementing agreement could assign priority to projects that support the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. To ensure that the competitive nature of the project-based approach takes sufficient account of the unequal capacities of countries and actors, promotes projects that serve collective interests beyond the specific area or actors involved in the project, and serves to strengthen coordination and cooperation between stakeholders, activities and countries to address global concerns, the implementing agreement could task the Secretariat with the organization of workshops and the provision of a helpdesk function to assist applicants to prepare proposals, similarly to what is being done under the ITPGRFA. In addition or as an alternative, the new implementing agreement could establish international criteria and guidelines for regional offices to identify and prioritize beneficiaries (States, but also indigenous peoples and local communities). The implementing agreement secretariat could receive advice from, and the benefit-sharing system could be reviewed by, an international advisory group of experts.

How and to what extent intellectual property rights may affect the possibilities for fair and equitable benefit-sharing is uncertain, and widely debated. Whether a patent can be obtained on an invention directly based on marine genetic resources will depend on whether the ordinary criteria for patentability, inter alia novelty and inventive step, are fulfilled. Under WIPO, in the Intergovernmental Committee for Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, the drafting of an international instrument for requiring disclosure of origin of genetic resources in patent applications is being discussed. Such disclosure requirement may facilitate possible access and benefit-sharing arrangements.264\n• The new instrument must reflect the status of marine genetic resources as the common heritage of mankind. Accordingly, it must embrace the principle of non-appropriation to ensure that no State will claim or exercise sovereignty or sovereign rights over marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The instrument should prohibit private appropriation and the exercise of intellectual property rights where this would limit access to marine genetic resources for further research and other aims.

This could include:\no recognising that MPAs represent an important mechanism for States to meet their obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment and, in this regard, requiring States and other entities to cooperate in the identification, designation and implementation of a comprehensive and representative network of marine protected areas, including through relevant regional and sectoral bodies; o providing an avenue for States to seek guidance on areas identified as needing additional levels of protection and requiring reporting within a set time frame on actions taken to implement this guidance (UNFSA 8(6) also relevant in this context); o providing standards and policy guidance on the design and process for ABMT/MPA initiatives that would guide Parties in pursuing initiatives through relevant bodies; o promoting regular and meaningful engagement within and between these bodies, and where appropriate, encouraging the establishment of regional coordinating mechanisms in cases where a number of bodies are active players in a specific ABMT/MPA regional context; and o mandating regular reporting by States, including through such bodies, in accordance with requirements established under the implementing agreement, to the COP.279\n• The new agreement, guided by the precautionary principle, should identify and adopt through the COP protected areas and specific measures to meet their conservation objectives, based on the based available science, information on cumulative impacts provided by the proponents, and the consultation process with Parties, non-Parties, scientific committee, regional/sectoral bodies, and all relevant stakeholders.280\n276 Norway 277 Canada 278 EU 279 New Zealand 280 Greenpeace\n• Set up a framework for effective cooperation and coordination among Parties, non-Parties and competent sectoral and regional organizations, in the establishment, management and enforcement of a network of ecologically representative, well connected and effectively managed MPAs, including marine reserves in areas beyond national jurisdiction.281\n• The new agreement will fill regulatory gaps, complement and strengthen existing frameworks and global, regional and sectoral bodies.

To this end, the creation of a (or the use of an existing) scientific subsidiary body, which could perform a technical evaluation of the MPA proposal, merits consideration.377 • Designated evaluating body requests best available science on the proposed area.378 • Establish a permanent scientific committee that assists in the review of ABMTs proposal and\noversee their implementation. Key to this process is the reliability and consistency in implementing ABMTs. Establish a scientific committee under an international legally binding instrument to inform States Parties of the character, scope and appropriate placements of ABMTs using best available technology. The role of this scientific committee is to-produce guidelines and recommendations on the appropriate ABMTs using best available technology. Key aspect of the role of this scientific committee is to give due consideration to the influence of climate change impacts on the suitable choice of ABMTs.379\n• A scientific committee will be established under the implementing agreement to discuss MPA proposals from a scientific viewpoint.\no Could have a new committee under the implementing agreement, or utilize a scientific committee of the existing frameworks; o Could have one scientific committee covering all sea areas or multiple scientific committees with each one covering a sea area; o Scientists from the existing frameworks and coastal States will be able to participate in discussions at the scientific committee; o Decision-making at the scientific committee should be by consensus in principle; o Proposals on which the scientific committee reached an agreement should be sent\nto the COP.

The framework in question will be requested to be present at the next meeting of the COP to report on the results of its consideration. If the framework in question decides to take different or no measures, the COP will ask the framework for consultations. The COP will duly respect the views of the existing frameworks, examine further as necessary, and endeavor to achieve the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ through dialogue and cooperation with the relevant frameworks.393\n• Provide a mechanism for consideration of potential management measures in designated areas for protection. It could include the following:\no a process by which information about a designated area for protection and information about activities that could potentially harm or cause adverse impacts to that area are referred to relevant bodies with purview over such activities for consideration and possible management measures or other action by those bodies, including adaptive\n391 Norway 392 Japan 393 Japan\nmanagement and, as appropriate, periodic review of any management measures implemented;\no when a designated area has multiple relevant bodies with purview over activities that could potentially harm or cause adverse impacts to that area, a process by which those bodies could coordinate and cooperate, including during the consideration of and, as appropriate, implementation of possible management measures; o a process by which proposed management measures for designated areas for protection that are not under the purview of another body could be developed and considered by Parties and those States and entities that are entitled to become Parties, including adaptive management and periodic review of any management measures implemented; o a requirement that any management measures and any enforcement of management measures are consistent with UNCLOS, including but not limited to sovereign immunity (in line with article 236) and the obligations in article 237.394\n• In the absence of any existing framework that deals with the proposed conservation and management measures, it may be necessary to set up a new regional management organization with necessary expertise. In this case, the COP, will encourage the countries and organizations concerned to establish a new organization or framework and to participate in its activities.\no Article 8. 5 of UNFSA: “Where there is no subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement to establish conservation and management measures for a particular straddling fish stock or highly migratory fish stock, relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas for such stock in the subregion or region shall cooperate to establish such an organization or enter into other appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management of such stock and shall participate in the work of the organization or arrangement.”395\n• Where there is no competent body to recommend measures to address the impact of a specific activity in the proposed area, the COP, guided by the precautionary principle, should identify specific measures to meet the conservation objectives of the area, based on information regarding cumulative impacts provided by the proponents, and the consultation process.396\n• Those outside the framework of the implementing agreement such as the existing frameworks and non-contracting Parties will be allowed to join discussions at the COP as observers.397\n• The decision-making at the COP will be by consensus of the State Parties in principle; however, further examination will be conducted as to whether or not decision making by a special majority of the Parties can be accepted if necessary and whether or not expressing objection should be accepted.398\n• Decision of the relevant existing framework or the new organization will not be binding on those States that are Parties to the implementing agreement but are not members of the existing framework or the new organization.399\n394 USA 395 Japan 396 Greenpeace 397 Japan 398 Japan 399 Japan\n• Decisions on ABMT should recognize ecologically significant/sensitive areas, and/or areas of interest in relation to conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (Areas of interest).400\n• The MPA designation could include a comprehensive approach that includes consideration of climate change impacts on all vertical realms (seabed, seabed and near-bottom waters, seabed and midwater, seabed and entire water column, surface waters).401\n• Decisions on ABMTs should be based on scientific data with ABMTs being universal and binding in nature (but limited to areas under the ABMTs). There may be a need for regular sessions out of this implementing agreement given the changing nature of the oceans and its uses and users.402 • Depending on the conservation objectives of individual MPAs, as well as the \"vulnerability\" of their features/ecosystems and the pressures on them, different levels of protection may be necessary.403 • There should be a different threshold for ABMTs (partial closure/stock specific/activity specific/full closure).404\n• The designation should be for an indefinite period to ensure the long-term conservation and resilience of marine biodiversity and ecosystem services and functions, and serve as reference areas for science.405\n• The designation of an MPA, its conservation objectives and the management measures cannot be considered as time-bound or temporary.406\n• The designation of an MPA should be for an indefinite period (neither the establishment of an MPA nor the implementation of conservation measures should be time-bound or temporary). However, a regular review based on the research and monitoring plan should be established to allow for its updating, amendment or de-designation, in accordance with the principles and approaches set out in the implementing agreement for the establishment of an MPA. If, at a later stage, an MPA falls entirely within a maritime area under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a coastal State, it shall cease to be in force. The coastal State may decide to adopt similar measures under its national law. In case of partial overlap its spatial boundaries will be amended accordingly.407\n• MPAs are indefinite in duration and appropriately regulated to best ensure the long-term conservation of marine biodiversity and ecosystem services. A particular MPA’s conservation and management plan and any specific measures applied to it may be adjusted to reflect the status of the area based on a review process.408\n400 Fiji 401 IUCN 402 Fiji 403 EU 404 Fiji 405 Greenpeace 406 Monaco 407 EU 408 High Seas Alliance"

This recognition should build upon the work that has been done by these global, regional/or sectoral bodies while not undermining the decisions made by those bodies.423\n• MPAs identified by regional bodies with a mandate to establish MPAs in areas beyond national jurisdiction should be included in the network of MPAs created under the implementing agreement, provided that they meet the criteria adopted in the implementing agreement.424\n• ABMTs must acknowledge and respect efforts by regional and subregional institutions managing certain areas beyond national jurisdiction as sanctioned by UNCLOS. Allow for regional and subregional institutions to operate towards implementing conservation and management measures of BBNJ.425\n• ABMTs are not designed to compete and undermine, but rather complement existing regulations. ABMTs must not undermine existing regulations that are implemented by RFMOs and SRFMOs.426 • Nothing in the new implementing agreement should prevent RFMOs from establishing their own ABMTs, including MPAs.427\n• Parties individually or collectively through relevant organizations should be able to propose existing protected areas that have been designated under regional or global agreements, as long as they comply with the relevant criteria and the proposal should include all the above elements.428 • A process for the recognition under the implementing agreement of existing MPAs in areas beyond national jurisdiction established by other organizations (e.g. by regional seas organizations) should be included in the agreement. Considering that best available scientific advice has been incorporated in these existing high seas MPA processes at regional levels (e.g. OSPAR, CCAMLR and Barcelona Convention), the COP could have the option to adopt them directly without reference to SBSTA, unless there is a need for further scientific input. The secretariat would then facilitate consultation with the implementing agreement Parties and stakeholders prior to the official adoption of any such MPAs by COP.429\n• Other types of sectoral ABMTs (e.g. RFMO VME closures, IMO PSSAs, or ISA APEIs) would not require a formal global recognition process, but should be informed to the COP and included in the clearing-house mechanism and information-sharing mechanism. These should also be integrated in ecosystem-based integrated oceans management plans or marine spatial plans, and analysis of potential pressures, stressors or impacts on these areas should be fully"

The non-complying Party and non-Party should be notified and offered a reasonable time to respond to the alleged non-compliance and rectify its actions or omissions. When necessary, the new agreement should adopt measures to facilitate compliance (e.g. technical assistance and capacity building) based on recommendations from the compliance committee. If the Party or non-Party in question continues to undermine the effectiveness of the protected area, and/or if the ecosystem or any of its components under protection is under serious threat, the Parties to the agreement\n450 Greenpeace\nshould adopt appropriate responsive measures.

State Parties to the implementing agreement should conduct EIAs in accordance with the guidelines in good faith.461 • A new global framework for EIAs in areas beyond national jurisdiction should: o provide for a central repository of publicly available data and information on EIAs, SEAs,\nand baseline data on areas beyond national jurisdiction; o provide guidance on the use of SEAs; o provide for coordination of information between countries, regions, sectoral, global and\nregional organizations, and relevant scientific bodies to facilitate the preparation, decision-making, monitoring and review of EIAs. This would help with transparency, accountability, effectiveness, and complement, not duplicate, the roles of existing international, regional or sectoral organizations; and o provide guidance to Parties on effectively implementing existing UNCLOS obligations relating to EIAs and improve coordination and implementation of EIAs.462\n• This section could set out the process for conducting EIAs consistent with article 206 of UNCLOS. Key issues that will have to be addressed during development of this section include:\no Should a new BBNJ instrument attempt to clarify what is meant by \"substantial pollution of or significant and harmful changes to the marine environment?\"\no How should transboundary effects be taken into account?463 • The recommendations of the CBD’s Revised Voluntary Guidelines for the Consideration of\nBiodiversity in Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Environmental Assessments in Marine and Coastal Areas (UNEP/CBD/COP/11/23) could be incorporated by reference, as well as other generally accepted minimum standards and EIA criteria. The criteria and guidance provided by the FAO International Guidelines on Deep-Sea Fisheries in the High Seas should also be incorporated, and the SBSTA could be tasked in developing further specific guidance to ensure coherence and to fill any gaps.464"

According to UNCLOS articles 204-206 the duty to conduct EIAs rests with the State under whose jurisdiction or control the activity in question takes place. The purpose of including provisions on EIAs in the implementing agreement must be to operationalize this duty.466\n• A State Party to the implementing agreement should be responsible for deciding, based on the thresholds or criteria included in the agreement that an environmental assessment is required. Accordingly, a State Party should:\no be required to ensure that EIAs are carried out, according to the agreed criteria, prior to engaging in or authorizing activities that may cause substantial pollution of or other significant and harmful changes (\"harmful effects\") to the marine environment in areas beyond national jurisdiction; o ensure that any such harmful effects are identified and taken into account in any decision making process and such activities are consistent with States' obligations under the UNCLOS to protect and preserve the marine environment, including through the adoption of suitable measures to prevent or mitigate any such harmful effects; o following the principle of due diligence linked to the requirement of article 204 of the UNCLOS, monitor the effects of activities (including policies, plans and programs) carried out after an environmental assessment and the compliance with any conditions (such as prevention, mitigation or compensation measures) related to their authorization; o make reports publically available on environmental assessments and on subsequent measures and monitoring results.467\n• States are responsible for meeting their obligations under UNCLOS, and as Parties to an implementing agreement, would be responsible for ensuring that EIAs are conducted by them in accordance with agreed criteria and processes.468\n• States should retain final decision-making authority with regard to the authorization of activities requiring EIAs, taking place in areas beyond national jurisdiction and which fall under their jurisdiction. States should be responsible for ensuring that EIAs are undertaken when required. Cooperation among States should be encouraged to mitigate the possible issue of ‘flags of convenience’ for those wishing to undertake activities with a high risk of significant adverse environmental impacts.469\n• Responsibility for conducting EIAs to rest primarily with flag States. Under this approach, the EIA is being conducted by the operator under the flag States' oversight and review.470 • In areas beyond national jurisdiction the responsibility to conduct EIAs would primarily rest with the flag State, but responsibility could also fall on another State being responsible for the planned activity. In addition, relevant international organizations with mandates on the high seas, including ISA and RFMOs, may have competence as regards EIAs in areas beyond national jurisdiction within specific sectors and/or areas. Thus, under the implementing agreement States should be obliged to conduct EIAs either directly or through relevant global, regional or sectoral bodies.471\n466 Norway 467 EU 468 New Zealand 469 Canada 470 Australia 471 Norway\n• Under a number of international and national regulations EIAs are conducted by the entity that intends to undertake the activity in question. The best result is often achieved when there is a close link between the EIA and the activity. However, it is still for the responsible State to make sure that the assessment is being made and to decide on whether or not the activity should be allowed and on what conditions.472 • States Parties should be required to ensure that an EIA is conducted, in accordance with the terms of the Instrument, prior to permitting any activity under their jurisdiction or control that may have a significant adverse impact on the marine environment in areas beyond national jurisdiction or is listed in an annex of activities presumed to have such impacts. Although the EIA may be carried out by the project proponent or its designee, it would be the responsibility of the State (or States) with jurisdiction over the proponent – by reason of flag, nationality, or beneficial ownership - to ensure that the EIA is conducted pursuant to the terms of the implementing agreement.473"

These could be based on one or more of the following options: o activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction not already covered by existing\nobligations and agreements; o specified activities listed in the new implementing agreement; and/ or o all activities reaching and/or exceeding an agreed threshold of effects.487\n• Identify the scope of \"planned activities\" for which EIAs would be conducted. It could include a provision stating that planned activities under a State's jurisdiction or control are those where the State exercises effective control over a particular activity or the State exercises jurisdiction in the form of licensing or funding a particular activity, and not simply activities conducted by a vessel flying a State's flag.488 • EIA must be mandatory for all proposed BBNJ activities. No minimum threshold of impact will be required.489\n• According to some instruments, for instance the Espoo Convention, some activities always require EIAs, whereas EIAs for other activities depend on the possible impact based on size of activity, location and effects, cf. for instance Espoo Appendix III. It should be explored whether under the implementing agreement some activities should always require EIAs.490 • Unnecessary to conduct another EIA under the implementing agreement in relation to activities for which an EIA is conducted appropriately under the existing frameworks. Ways and means should be considered to avoid overlaps, such as establishing a clear provision to this effect.491 • No activity should be seen as by definition exempt. Initial assessment will be required to determine whether significant impacts are likely and formal EIA assessment and reporting are required as a result. SEAs are also a way to ensure cumulative impacts do not exceed significant impacts.492\n• An EIA regime under the implementing agreement should set a defined threshold(s) for environmental impacts that would trigger a requirement to undertake an EIA. The implementing agreement should set thresholds at a level that captures impacts that are significant or greater. Following existing treaty formulations, the implementing agreement may characterize 'significant impacts' as activity that is likely to have significant adverse effects on biological diversity, or may cause substantial pollution of, or significant harmful changes to, the marine environment. Thresholds based on UNCLOS article 206, complemented by an illustrative list of activities.493\n485 Norway 486 Norway 487 New Zealand 488 USA 489 Federated States of Micronesia 490 Norway 491 Japan 492 Australia 493 Australia\n• In order to trigger a conduct of EIAs, qualitative threshold such as “reasonable grounds to believe that a proposed activity may cause significant and harmful changes to the environment” could be used.

If there is a necessity to have such list, it must be possible to review or to update it.494\n• The implementing agreement should help operationalise generic formulae such as “reasonable grounds for believing that planned activities […] may cause […] significant and harmful changes” (article 206 UNCLOS), including through setting thresholds or criteria.495\n• Article 206 of UNCLOS sets the threshold of an EIA; it provides that an EIA will be conducted “when States have reasonable grounds for believing that planned activities under their jurisdiction or control may cause substantial pollution of or significant and harmful changes to the marine environment.”496\n• The applicable threshold, that is the starting point for the implementing agreement, is activities that: “may cause substantial pollution of or significant and harmful changes to the marine environment”.497 • The CBD COP 8 Decision VIII/28 “Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment” may provide useful options for this part of the BBNJ instrument. However, it would be preferable to have EIAs for activities with ‘more than a minor or transitory effect’ as per the Environment Protocol of the Antarctic Treaty System.498\n• Triggering conditions and thresholds for carrying out EIAs and SEAs could include activities with the potential for significant adverse impacts, recognizing the increasingly vulnerable state of marine ecosystems and resources from climate induced changes, including from ocean acidification.499\n• Include a threshold where an activity has the potential for “significant adverse effects, or alternatively, as utilized in the Madrid Protocol, a preliminary threshold of a “minor or transitory impact” that leads to a multi-layered approach to assessment with increasing requirements based on the level of potential harm. It is also important that screening and scoping criteria take into account possible cumulative effects, including those resulting from climate change, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation that may increase the significance of the effect of proposed projects.500\n• All activities are to be assessed against a threshold-based approach that would be contained in an annex to the agreement. This would be based on the likelihood of significant adverse impacts (individually or combined) to occur on marine ecosystems, marine biodiversity and ecosystem services. The geographical area (and ecological relevance, considering presence of e.g. EBSAs, VMEs, PSSAs, IBAs, IMMA, ecological corridors) where the effects of the proposed activity are likely to occur should also play a role in determining the threshold.501\n494 G77&China 495 EU 496 Japan 497 Norway 498 CARICOM 499 IUCN 500 High Seas Alliance 501 WWF\n• In order to trigger a conduct of EIAs, qualitative threshold such as “reasonable grounds to believe that a proposed activity may cause significant and harmful changes to the environment” could be used.

If there is a necessity to have such list, it must be possible to review or to update it.502\n• There could be an indicative list of activities that present significant adverse effects and therefore would require EIAs.503 • Another complementary approach is to provide a list of activities in an Annex that would always require an EIA, such as found in the Espoo Convention. When applying a list approach, it is important that the list be adaptable over time to reflect new and emerging uses. A combination of the tiered threshold approach and a list approach could be adopted.504\n• The instrument should also apply to activities organized in or proceeding from the territory of States Parties, as is the case with the Antarctic Treaty in article VII.5. Such a requirement would be consistent with UNCLOS article 194.2 and would assist States to implement their obligations under international law including CBD article 14 with respect to processes and activities under their jurisdiction or control.505"

If there is a necessity to have such list, it must be possible to review or to update it; o Scoping – there is a need to identify which potential impacts are relevant to assess. To this end, some standard components of an EIA, such as the description of the proposed activity; the potential environmental impact of that activity, including specific information necessary for identifying and assessing the environmental effects of the proposed activity; and a description of the proposed measures to mitigate the predicted adverse impact should be included; o Assessment and evaluation of impacts - an assessment of the potential impacts of the proposed activities in every dimension should be taken into account.

The activity is then screened to determine whether it meets the threshold triggering an EIA. Any State that could be affected by the proposed activity should so be notified. If the threshold is met, then an EIA is conducted in accordance, at the minimum, with international standards and made publicly available through the mandated channel under the BBNJ instrument. To ensure environmental integrity, the EIA should be subject to a technical expert review, with recommendations on whether or not the activity should proceed. For purposes of transparency, it would be appropriate if the independent assessment is made public as part of any consultative process. If there is any objection to the assessment, this could be the subject of appeal.512\n• Process of an EIA should be as follows: o formulation of a draft activity by a proponent; o decision on the necessity of an EIA by each State Party; o formulation of a draft EIA (including items to be assessed and methods to be adopted); o publication of a draft EIA;\n510 Federated States of Micronesia 511 G77&China 512 CARICOM\no implementation of an EIA; o preparation and publication of an EIA report; o implementation of an activity reflecting outcomes of an EIA; o monitoring and publication of outcomes.513\n• A possible procedure could include the following elements: o development of a draft EIA; o draft EIAs is submitted to a central repository/DOALOS for publication and invite\nrelevant stakeholders to comment on the draft within a set deadline; o the EIA is finalized, based on the draft EIA and comments received; o the final EIA is approved and a decision is made as to whether the activity may be\ncarried out and on what conditions; o final EIA and decision to be sent to the central repository/DOALOS; o the implementing agreement should include an obligation to monitor the activity and its\nimpact on the marine environment; o any completed EIA should be included in a report to the State Parties Meeting.

The SEA in this case would serve as a regional environmental assessment where cumulative effects of different activities and thresholds for individual activities effects as well as cross-sectoral conflicts could be identified. SEA information and outcomes would need to be subject to regular review;\no Individual EIAs in the region under consideration would be guided by the outcome and information resulting from SEAs/regional environmental assessments. Proponents of projects or activities likely to affect BBNJ in the region under consideration would have to submit an environmental impact statement, based on guidelines provided by the respective SEAs/regional environmental assessments, to relevant responsible States which need to have national capacities in place to assess the likelihood of significant adverse impacts on BBNJ. States parties would then be responsible for submitting a project proposal for a screening phase conducted by the relevant body in cooperation with SBSTA; o If concluded that an EIA is required, the commonly known steps of an EIA procedure would then need to be conducted, with the level of assessment proportionate to the likely scale of impacts based on application of relevant guidelines, namely:  scoping by the relevant body (assisted by SBSTA, SEA/EIA administrative\noversight committee with the involvement of the regional committees and/or competent organizations as appropriate) with public participation (e.g. online consultations);\n impact analysis;  mitigation and impact management proposals;  EIA report submission to SBSTA, SEA/EIA administrative oversight committee\n(with the involvement of the regional committees and/or competent organizations as appropriate) for review;\n review with public participation (e.g. online consultation) and recommendation to COP;  COP decision approving or not approving the activity/project (and associated packages of conditions, including required measures);  implementation, monitoring and reporting to the appropriate body and ultimately COP.516"

The related evaluation and analysis of the risks and potential impacts or effects of the proposed activities to marine environment should be done on the basis of recognized scientific methods.527 • Environmental assessment reports made pursuant to the implementing agreement should, inter alia, include:\no a description of the assessed activities and the likelihood that they will cause substantial pollution of, or other significant and harmful changes to, the marine environment in areas beyond national jurisdiction and its biodiversity; o a description of the measures for avoiding, preventing, mitigating and, where necessary and possible, redressing any substantial pollution of, or other significant and harmful changes to, the marine environment.528\n• EIAs could: o describe potentially affected environments, including potentially sensitive or vulnerable\nareas; o identify potential environmental impacts, including direct, indirect, short-term and long-\nterm, positive and negative effects; o identify measures available to mitigate any potential significant adverse impacts; and, o include follow up actions to verify the accuracy of the environmental assessment and\nthe effectiveness of mitigation measures.529 • Provide standard information on what an EIA needs to contain, a generic EIA template and\nguidance on its use, and guidance on decision-making processes for EIAs in areas beyond national jurisdiction. This would enable proposers of an activity to know what the EIA should cover and reviewing agencies what to expect. The template should not be too prescriptive as content may differ between activities and areas.530\n• The implementing agreement could specify the basic content and requirements of EIAs, for instance that EIAs should be based on the best available scientific information.

Some activities may have impacts on areas beyond the immediate activity area – for example trenching or mining may cause plumes of sediment which could travel some distance from the site of the original activity. The effects on these “environmental impact areas” should be considered, along with any dependent or associated ecosystems.533\n• The scope of EIAs could: o include assessment of vulnerability to climate stressors; o include assessment of ecosystem services provided by the area of interest; and o include potential impacts to ecosystem services; o recognize that ecosystem services derive from multiple life stages, migrations, water or\nchemical movements, and other transboundary processes, and reflect the potential for cumulative impacts to these services by activities in widely separated areas.534\n• Require that any assessments account for cumulative impacts of activities and climate change.535 • Individual and cumulative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services should be assessed\n(building upon any SEA that might have already been completed).536\n531 Norway 532 High Seas Alliance 533 New Zealand 534 IUCN 535 High Seas Alliance 536 WWF\n• EIAs and SEAs could recognize that climate change may: o vary biodiversity independent of other stressors; o be a source of cumulative impacts; and o compound anthropogenic disturbance-induced change (e.g. plumes generated from\nseabed mining may exacerbate climate-induced effects, including from ocean acidification).537"

For example, a 'clearing house' could be created that would collect and disseminate details of implementing agreement Parties' capacity building and technology transfer projects and opportunities for developing State participation. Consider how this instrument could be made effective and fit for purpose and how it would relate to other organizations with competency in the field of marine science and technology transfer. Consider whether a virtual clearing house is also an appropriate tool.653\n• One or more clearing-house mechanisms, which could provide prioritized lists of required capacity-building efforts and marine technology and which may have a “match-making” function to facilitate the transfer of technology and capacity building assistance, could be an effective means of achieving this.654\n• Establish a clearing-house mechanism that facilitates information sharing in connection to activities on the BBNJ, particularly (but not limited to) scientific data, research results (especially for marine genetic resources), and best practices. Capacity building requires public access to information relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of living resources of the areas beyond national jurisdiction. Access of information can be carried out through a clearing-house of data. Such access can follow the principles contained in the Aarhus Convention.655\n• Include provisions for a possible repository or clearinghouse for data, information, capacity building, and/or technology transfer that is not unduly burdensome, and that would coordinate with, build upon, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing international mechanisms already in place.656 • Provide an effective platform for enhancing collaboration and coordination for capacity building and technology transfer. At a minimum, provide a platform where initiatives can be tracked and coordinated so that various options for effective support can be easily navigated by developing countries and the needs easily identified by donors for planning purposes.657\n• Establish a clearing-house that, similarly to the approach envisioned for the ITPGRFA Global Information System has the mandate to:\no provide a web-based entry point to information and knowledge that is specifically geared towards strengthening the capacity for the conservation and sustainable utilization of BBNJ; o promote and facilitate interoperability among existing information systems (through the development of principles and technical standards); o create a mechanism to assess progress and monitor effectiveness in information sharing through online databases (feedback and periodic consultations);\n652 EU 653 Australia 654 Canada 655 Federated States of Micronesia 656 USA 657 IUCN\no enhance opportunities for collaboration (including focus on high-priority material); and o provide capacity development and technology transfer.658\n• The idea of a clearing-house mechanism and a capacity-building network could be developed, using, inter alia, web-based tools. Those tools can be a platform to access, evaluate, publish and disseminate information, as well as to provide a case-by-case option upon request. The experience of the CBD and the UNFCCC (Climate Technology Centre and Network as well as the Technology Needs Assessment), for example, could be instrumental in this regard.659\n• Include a provision to improve the interoperability and linkages between existing mechanisms, including in terms of data and sample collection and sharing.660\n• The further consideration of IOC as a possible clearing-house mechanism for the future implementing agreement would require an assessment of the current activities of this organization with reference to the objectives of the future implementing agreement, as well as of the possible requirements and implications of strengthening and improving its existing structures to better address – beyond the technology transfer dimension – the capacity-building dimension and the focus on areas beyond national jurisdiction, in a context of sustainable development.661\n• The IOC could be charged with utilizing the Ocean Biogeographic Information System to develop an international meta-database or clearing-house mechanism to facilitate an effective mechanism for accessing and exchanging information relevant to capacity building and technology transfer for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Such meta-database or a clearing-house mechanism can also be used to monitor needs, fulfillment of such needs to facilitate planning for future initiatives as well as foster projects and programs that are tailored to the needs at the local, national, and regional level.662"

Delivering innovation, scalability and standardization through a “blue finance hub” as a knowledge, skills and project preparation center, for instance in the format of an “Ocean Sustainability Bank” could be an important tool to significantly increase marine technology impact. New initiatives such as the recently launched Coalition for Private Investment in Conservation could be taken into consideration when developing further participation in the effort. Additional funding can be found by structuring blended financial instruments that allow both public and private participation.667 • Include a process to establish a multilateral fund to support regional scientific and technological centers with pooled global resources in order to enhance technology transfer efforts. Further voluntary payments could be made by ocean users, for instance taking into account their carbon footprints, as a means to support ocean conservation efforts.668\n• Funding and Institutional arrangements could be based on both voluntary and monetary proceeds - See Nagoya Protocol and ISA capacity building funding arrangements.669"

Its mandate, under the guidance of the global decision-making body of the BBNJ agreement and drawing upon existing competent international bodies, would be to:  elaborate and recommend to the decision-making body global criteria for the\nestablishment of ABMTs, including MPAs (to be adopted by the decision making body);\n elaborate and recommend to the decision-making body criteria and thresholds for activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction, in the context of EIAs, (to be adopted by the decision making body);  review and provide recommendations to the decision making body regarding designation of ABMTs, and submissions on EIAs (the submissions could also be produced by regional expert committees);  elaborate and recommend to the decision-making body guidelines for the access and benefit-sharing regime;  identify innovative, efficient and state-of-the-art technologies and know-how relating to the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ and advise on the ways and means to promote the development and/or transfer of such technologies;  identify new and emerging issues relating to the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ;  provide advice on scientific programmes and international cooperation in research and development related to conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ;  respond to scientific, technical, technological and methodological questions that the intergovernmental body and its subsidiary bodies may submit;  provide regular assessments of the state of scientific knowledge of BBNJ. Among its members, the committee should include experts in traditional knowledge or seek the input of relevant traditional knowledge holders in regards to any given project, issue, programme or activity.\no Compliance committee: this committee would review general issues of compliance and implementation of the BBNJ implementing agreement, in particular it would:  review progress on implementation and report to the intergovernmental\ndecision-making body;  make recommendations on how to improve coordination among all relevant\nstakeholders;  make recommendations for strategic actions to enhance implementation;  make recommendations to strengthen means of implementation;\n make recommendations on how to improve the effectiveness of processes and activities under the agreement.\nThe committee could be composed of the following two branches:  The facilitative branch would provide advice and assistance to Parties in order to\npromote compliance;  The enforcement branch would have the responsibility to determine\nconsequences for Parties not meeting their commitments. o Finance and administration committee: the mandate of the finance and administration\ncommittee would be to:  draft financial rules, regulations and procedures;  assess contributions of Parties;  draft rules, regulations and procedures on the equitable sharing of financial and\nother economic benefits derived from MGRs and the decisions to be made thereon;\n review and plan budget;  monitor the funds established in the agreement;  report to the decision-making body.703\n• COP subsidiary bodies and respective functions to be as follows: o SBSTA\n the proposed SBSTA would be comprised of delegations of qualified experts from parties and observers, to provide advice and guide COP in its deliberations.\n this body could also establish ad hoc working groups and work with independent scientists and experts to deliver their mandate. The SBSTA would also collate and build upon relevant existing scientific information from relevant organizations (e.g. CBD, FAO, United Nations Environment Programme, UNESCO, ISA, IMO) in exercising its functions and mandate, including providing scientific and technical advice on establishing ecologically representative MPA networks, biogeographical classification schemes or assessing cumulative impacts of human activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\n the SBSTA would also support the regional committees, as needed, with technical and scientific input as required. It is also recommended that this SBSTA be given a broad mandate to also initiate its own work plans in pursuit of its own objectives and purposes, especially in developing operational standards, criteria and guidance/guidelines to give effect to general principles, purposes, aims and objectives set out in the implementing agreement for adoption by the COP, as well as providing scientific and technical assistance in operationalising ecosystem-based integrated oceans management at appropriate biogeographic scales.\no SEA/EIA administrative oversight committee  this body would be responsible for ensuring that the particular parts of EIA and\nSEA (including bioregional SEA) processes are properly conducted by the appropriate entities (which may be decided pursuant to standing arrangements\n703 PSIDS\nor on a case by case basis, generally with EIAs being done by capable individual operators, and SEAs being done by those bodies with the appropriate level of collective responsibility, either sectorally or cross-sectorally, depending on the scope or location of the particular SEA).\n this body would establish guidelines for and ensure appropriate assessment of EIAs, especially in establishing professional technical teams to guide and assess EIAs and guide/conduct SEAs. This body would work in close cooperation with the SBSTA and any regional committees and competent organizations and provide advice to COP on EIAs and SEAs. Its oversight will be particularly important in regions that have not yet established a regional committee.\no Subsidiary body on finance, capacity building and technology transfer  this body would be responsible for facilitating resource mobilisation to facilitate\nimplementation of the implementing agreement and for providing assistance to Parties, especially developing countries, and among those, particularly least developed countries and SIDS, in implementing the implementing agreement.\no Subsidiary body on compliance and implementation  Parties should be required to report on the implementation of the implementing\nagreement and any COP decisions, based upon pre-determined reporting criteria. The proposed subsidiary body on compliance and implementation would examine such reports prior to meetings of the COP and recommend to the COP steps that should be taken to enhance such implementation (including incentives as well as possible sanctions in accordance with the respective noncompliance provisions and mechanisms established by the implementing agreement). Such body could also be tasked to undertake non-compliance procedures. Non-compliance complaints by non-State actors could also be received by this body for further analysis and brought to the attention of the COP for appropriate follow up. 704\n• Establishment of a body, such as a compliance committee, that could address cases of noncompliance, including duties of enhanced cooperation. This body could investigate allegations of breach, find facts as necessary and, where appropriate, recommend to the State(s) in question the action to be taken to fulfill the obligation. Technical assistance could be offered to address capacity issues.705"

Establishment of such committees would be by COP acceptance of a proposal by\n706 PSIDS\na group of proponent member States with the relevant interest. As committees of the implementing agreement, they would be empowered to establish subsidiary arrangements as they see fit to fulfill their respective mandates.\n the principal mandate delegated to any such regional committees by the COP, in accordance with the implementing agreement, would be to facilitate the implementing agreement implementation by overseeing and facilitating enhanced cooperation between States (in respect of all their relevant sovereign competencies) and existing bodies and arrangements, including sectoral bodies with competency for controlling activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction (i.e. ISA, IMO and relevant RFMOs) in a manner and to an extent that does not undermine them, but ensures a concerted and comprehensive legal regime, consistent with UN General Assembly resolution 69/292. Additionally, regional committees could be delegated to exercise residual powers to fill any identified governance and regulatory gaps as deemed necessary by the COP to meet the implementing agreement objectives.\n These proposed committees would work closely with other subsidiary bodies under the implementing agreement in exercising oversight of the implementation of the implementing agreement, including of decisions taken by the COP and other identified relevant bodies. In areas where such regional committees or other appropriate arrangements have not been established, the COP would continue to exercise its oversight responsibilities in the same way, without undermining relevant bodies and arrangements as per UN General Assembly resolution 69/292.707"

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION / CLEARING-HOUSE MECHANISM\n• Exchange of information and data should be promoted between States as well as relevant\nregional, sectoral and international organizations (similar to article 17 of CBD).715 • Clear information principles should be established that allow meeting papers, meeting reports,\ndecisions, annual reports and results of any performance monitoring of the organization to be made available in a timely manner to Parties, civil society and outside institutions.716\n• States and subregional or regional biological diversity management organizations and arrangements should give due publicity to conservation and sustainable management measures and ensure that laws, regulations and other legal rules governing their implementation are effectively disseminated. The bases and purposes of such measures should be explained to users of biological diversity and its resources in order to facilitate their application and thus gain increased support in the implementation of such measures.717\n• Sharing of information and scientific knowledge will be fundamental to achieve a more holistic approach to ocean management. A repositary where States and regional and sectorial bodies could post relevant information should be established.718\n• A clearing-house mechanism to promote and facilitate technical and scientific cooperation, knowledge and data sharing.719\n• A clearing-house mechanism to facilitate implementation through, e.g., information and knowledge sharing and scientific and technical cooperation.720\n• A clearing-house mechanism, hosted by the secretariat, would provide centralized access and sharing of information for all, contributing to enhanced transparency and equity. An evolutionary approach could be employed where these information sharing functions would be carried out by the secretariat until such a time when the extraction of marine genetic resources becomes a reality, at which point a specific body would be established. The clearing-house mechanism could provide, inter alia:\no global information services such as a website for the agreement, a network of experts and practitioners among Parties and partners, mechanisms for Parties and partners to exchange information; o network for clearing-house mechanisms at the regional and or national levels. This clearing-house mechanism could also include specific activities to enhance and promote information sharing and dissemination in and with SIDS, as well as provide for specific programmes for SIDS to contribute to the expansion of these mechanisms.

The regional clearing-house mechanism could build on existing ones in order to limit duplication and improve communication and diffusion of information to the relevant actors. There could either be discussion for a centralized regional clearing-house mechanism, or to identify one single entry point that would be the link with all existing mechanisms.723"

MONITORING, REVIEW, COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT\n• Bearing in mind that also various non-State actors will carry out activities regulated by the implementing agreement, the implementing agreement should contain provisions requiring States to enact legislation and regulations and/or adopt measures necessary to ensure compliance with the standards and procedures set up in the implementing agreement.730\n• States should establish, within their respective competences and capacities, effective mechanisms for monitoring, surveillance, control and enforcement of their entities operating in areas beyond national jurisdiction to ensure compliance with their conservation and sustainable management measures, as well as those adopted by subregional or regional organizations or arrangements.731 • There should be a mechanism under the new agreement for a global MCS system for areas beyond national jurisdiction to ensure that protected areas are meeting their objectives and to identify violations by vessels as well as cases of regular non-compliance. This mechanism should facilitate information sharing and joint operations between existing MCS systems. The global monitoring system should be supported by a scientific, technical, financial and capacity building mechanism to ensure equal monitoring standards for all protected areas across regions and facilitate their implementation by Parties, in particular developing States. The implementation of the scientific monitoring could be delegated to appropriate regional bodies when possible as long as they meet the standards set by the new agreement.732\n• Set up a regular reporting and review process whereby: o Parties and relevant regional or global bodies should report back regularly on the\nimplementation of conservation and management measures. These reports should be publicly available.\no a regular review process should incorporate input from the scientific committee established under the new agreement, all relevant regional or global bodies, and stakeholders, including civil society, as well as information gathered through the global MCS system regarding the effectiveness of the protected areas, their conservation and management plans and progress toward their objectives. o The review process should publish a progress report and identify any shortcomings by Parties, non-Parties, and regional or global bodies, affecting the effectiveness of the measures adopted by the agreement.733\n• Establish a compliance mechanism. Following the outcome of the review process, Parties, stakeholders, including civil society, as well as the compliance committee itself may submit a report of non-compliance. When a Party or a non-Party is identified to have failed to discharge its obligations under the new agreement or, in the case of non-Parties, under international law, to co-operate on the protection and preservation of the marine environment, by not taking measures or exercising effective control to ensure that its vessels or nationals do not engage in any activity that undermines the effectiveness of the agreement’s conservation measures, the\n730 EU 731 Fiji 732 Greenpeace 733 Greenpeace\ncompliance committee should make recommendations on ways to rectify their acts or omissions. The non-complying Party and non-Party should be notified and offered a reasonable time to respond to the alleged non-compliance and rectify its actions or omissions. When necessary, the new agreement should adopt measures to facilitate compliance (e.g. technical assistance and capacity building) based on recommendations from the compliance committee. If the Party or non-Party in question continues to undermine the effectiveness of the protected area, and/or if the ecosystem or any of its components under protection is under serious threat, the Parties to the agreement should adopt appropriate responsive measures. The responsive measures should be designed to ensure that the conservation objectives of the area are met.734\n734 Greenpeace\nVIII. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES\n• There could be a dispute prevention mechanism to preempt any dispute from arising. Such issues could be examined either by a specific committee or by selected experts. If this process fails to resolve any issues, then the involved parties could seek peaceful settlement of disputes through mechanisms provided for in Part XV.735\n• Include a provision concerning the obligation of the Parties to resolve their disputes relating to the interpretation and application of the implementing agreement by peaceful means. Due to their nature, most of possible disputes relating to matters under the implementing agreement would qualify, at the same time, also as disputes under UNCLOS.736\n• The provisions of UNCLOS relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes reflect a good starting point for consideration of dispute resolution under the instrument.737 • Use of the UNCLOS Part XV dispute resolution framework.738 • Article 30 of UNFSA provides procedures for which a rendition suited to the new implementing\nagreement could be made.739 • A dispute resolution mechanism could be an expansion of the mandate of the International\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) or a new body using ITLOS as model.740 • Dispute settlement procedures in UNCLOS and UNFSA for compulsory settlement of disputes\ncould be drawn on when developing dispute resolution procedures for the new implementing agreement.741\n• The option to seek an advisory opinion from ITLOS should also be considered as a useful means for resolving differences in interpretation of the new agreement.742 • It is paramount for the new agreement to include a streamlined, rapid, accessible, transparent and cost-effective dispute settlement mechanism to resolve disputes arising from its implementation, enhancing and complementing existing mechanisms under UNCLOS. Such mechanism needs to be based on modern principles of good governance and ensure transparency, public participation and accountability and follow contemporary approaches as in the Espoo Convention with its implementation committee or the Aarhus Convention with its compliance committee.743\n• Existing mechanisms under UNCLOS (e.g. ITLOS) are a good starting point but are not sufficient. The dispute settlement mechanism should incorporate a progressive approach and be accessible, efficient, support good governance, transparency and accountability. Specific clauses to be considered include qualified opt-out mechanisms. One example of how to integrate good governance and dispute resolution is the South Pacific RFMO Convention, where a Party can implement an opt-out mechanism, which allows the measure to go forward and at the same"

RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY\n• Provision similar to article 35 of UNFSA.746 • The Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts elaborated by the\nInternational Law Commission and attached to the UN General Assembly resolution 56/83 represent an authoritative body of international law in this field. They are frequently referred to by international courts as reflecting rules of customary international law.

REVIEW • Establishment of a mechanism for regular review of the effectiveness and implementation of the\nagreement, similar to the review mechanism set out in article 36 of UNFSA. Reviews should be carried out, based on agreed criteria, within a set period of time after entry into force of the agreement, for example after five years, and regularly thereafter.750\n744 High Seas Alliance 745 EU 746 New Zealand 747 EU 748 WWF 749 PSIDS 750 New Zealand\nXII. FINAL ELEMENTS • The implementing agreement should contain standard final clauses. Their consideration is\npremature at this stage, though, and should be hence left to the future intergovernmental conference.751\n• This section should be addressed at a later stage, if the General Assembly decides to convene an intergovernmental conference, and could include provisions relating to settlement of disputes; signature; ratification and accession; entry into force; reservations and exceptions; declarations and statements; amendment; denunciation; participation by international organizations; depository; and authentic texts.752 • Final provisions based on those in articles 37 to 50 UNFSA.753 • One of the issues which could be given some consideration at a later stage is the necessity and\npossibility of provisional application of the implementing agreement.754 • Universal participation in the instrument should be sought and participation should be open to\nall States, regardless of whether they are parties to UNCLOS.755 • Consider universal participation, where parties and non-parties to UNCLOS can become party to\nit.756 • Participation in the instrument should extend to all States and other entities in like manner as\nthe participation in the UNFSA.757 • Similarly to article 305 in connection with Annex IX of UNCLOS, it should also be open for\nsignature by international organizations allowing for the participation of the European Union.758 • Open for signature, ratification and accession by all States and other entities on the same basis\nas provided for in UNFSA (UNFSA articles 37-39).759"
