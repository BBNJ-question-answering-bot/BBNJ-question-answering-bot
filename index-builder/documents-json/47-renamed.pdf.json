      "text" : "1. The views expressed and the textual proposals made during the first week of the fifth session of the conference, either by individual delegations or the result of small group discussions, were considered in the preparation of the refreshed draft text, while taking note that some small groups were still in discussions. Ideas that reflected a general direction in the discussions have been incorporated, although the precise textual formulations proposed by delegations may not always have been utilized. While not every individual idea or proposal is necessarily reflected, the text presented is an attempt at reflecting the general thrust of those ideas and proposals. New language has been proposed, in some cases, in an attempt to offer a possible way forward by bridging existing differences. Certain options have been eliminated or merged.\n2. Square brackets have been used to indicate: (a) where there are differences in drafting that do not reflect different conceptual approaches; and (b) where a certain level of support has been expressed for a “no text” option, either within a provision or with regard to a provision as a whole. However, the absence of square brackets does not imply agreement on the ideas, content or specific language reflected in a provision. The absence of brackets around new ideas that are reflected in the draft text for the first time should not be taken to mean that their inclusion is a fait accompli. Equally, the fact that some provisions which have been discussed during the first week have not been revised should not be taken to indicate agreement on the unrevised provisions.\n2/61\n3. The content of the refreshed draft text is without prejudice to the position of any delegation on any of the matters referred to therein and does not preclude the consideration of matters not included in the document.\n4. A document showing the revisions to the further revised draft text of an agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (A/CONF.232/2022/5) as marked-up text is available to facilitate delegation’s review of the text.\n3/61\n4/61"

    "abstractText" : "1. The views expressed and the textual proposals made during the first week of the fifth session of the conference, either by individual delegations or the result of small group discussions, were considered in the preparation of the refreshed draft text, while taking note that some small groups were still in discussions. Ideas that reflected a general direction in the discussions have been incorporated, although the precise textual formulations proposed by delegations may not always have been utilized. While not every individual idea or proposal is necessarily reflected, the text presented is an attempt at reflecting the general thrust of those ideas and proposals. New language has been proposed, in some cases, in an attempt to offer a possible way forward by bridging existing differences. Certain options have been eliminated or merged.",
