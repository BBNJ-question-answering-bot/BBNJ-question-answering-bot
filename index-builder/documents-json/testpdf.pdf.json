Al respecto, CLAM recibe con agrado que se haya tomado en cuenta la importancia de la equidad intergeneracional en el uso sostenible y conservación de la biodiversidad marina y se considera que tener una referencia expresa en el preámbulo resulta favorable para efectos de la interpretación y aplicación del instrumento. No obstante, la palabra “administradores” tiene diversas connotaciones incluyendo aquellas de cuidador e incluso representante, lo que puede confundir la interpretación del propio instrumento y el alcance de las obligaciones de los Estados. En ese sentido, CLAM considera que la redacción debería limitarse al reconocimiento del principio de equidad intergeneracional, quedando de la siguiente manera: “Deseando actuar de acuerdo con el principio de equidad intergeneracional en los océanos”\n3\n[English version]"

CLAM welcomes the reference in the preamble to the intergenerational equity principle in sustainable use and conservation of marine resources, which CLAM believes is fortunate for the interpretation and application of the instrument as a whole. However, the word “stewards” has various connotations in Spanish language including those of custodian, keeper and even representative, which may confuse the interpretation of the instrument itself and the scope of the obligations of States. In that sense, CLAM considers that the wording should be limited to the recognition of the intergenerational equity principle, as follows: \"Desiring to act by the principle of intergenerational equity in the oceans\""

The ocean is dynamic and interconnected, from the surface to the seafloor and from the coasts to the high seas. Timescales governing relevant ecosystems vary for each environment. Ecological connectivity, whether through carbon and energy flow or species’ dispersal and migration, plays a critical role in maintaining healthy ocean functions (DOSI, 2020). Biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction provides a suite of functions that maintain ecosystem integrity and benefit humans in myriad ways, including: carbon sequestration and storage, nutrient recycling, food provision, scientific inspiration, and cultural significance (DOSI 2019a; Hoagland et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2014). The Preamble of the BBNJ agreement could make reference to the broad importance of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction and the environmental, economic, cultural, social, and scientific value of biodiversity and genetic and biological resources of ABNJ."

      "text" : "Artículo 1 Términos Empleados 3. En la definición de “mecanismo de gestión basado en zonas geográficas”, en la versión en inglés del documento CLAM sugiere utilizar la palabra “measure” y no “tool”. Además, sugiere eliminar la última parte del texto de la definición que figura entre corchetes [y ofrecer mayor protección que en las zonas circundantes], pues pueden existir ABMTs más restrictivas en la zona contigua al área propuesta. CLAM propone que la definición lea: Por “mecanismo de gestión basado en zonas geográficas” se entiende cualquier medida para una zona geográficamente delimitada, mediante el cual se gestionan uno o varios sectores o actividades con el fin de alcanzar determinados objetivos de conservación y uso sostenible, de conformidad con este tratado”. (5 Bis). El CLAM solicita nuevamente a la Presidenta la incorporación de una definición sobre el término “Creación de Capacidades”, de acuerdo a la siguiente propuesta: “5bis. \"creación de capacidad\" se entiende toda actividad destinada a permitir o mejorar la formación académica, profesional y técnica; el intercambio de conocimientos y competencias; el acceso a infraestructuras físicas; el fortalecimiento institucional; la comunicación entre actores relevantes; el intercambio de información científica, de desarrollo tecnológico e innovación; y la sensibilización a través de información pública y conocimientos básicos sobre la biodiversidad marina en áreas fuera de la jurisdicción nacional.” La definición propuesta no se encuentra reflejada de esa forma en un documento, sino que se basa en una adaptación de conceptos incluidos en la Estrategia de Desarrollo de Capacidades de la COI 2015-2021 (Documento IOC/INF-1332 disponible a través de http://www.iocunesco.org/index.php?option=com_oe&task=viewDocumentRecord&docID=14939), tomando parte de los \"productos\" y \"actividades\" (o \"outputs\" y \"activities\"), para los fines de este instrumento internacional legalmente vinculante. (11.) CLAM solicita eliminar los ejemplos y la palabra “observación” sustituirla por “innovación”. De esta forma, el inciso 11 leería: [11. Por “tecnología marina” se entienden elementos como información y datos, suministrados en un formato de fácil utilización, sobre las ciencias marinas y las operaciones y servicios marinos conexos; manuales, directrices, criterios, normas y materiales de referencia; equipo de muestreo y metodología; instalaciones y equipo de observación (por ejemplo, equipo de teledetección, boyas, mareógrafos y medios de observación de los océanos a bordo de buques y de otra índole); equipo para observaciones, análisis y experimentos in situ y en laboratorio; computadoras y programas informáticos, incluidos modelos y técnicas de modelización; y experiencia, conocimientos, aptitudes, conocimientos técnicos, científicos y jurídicos y métodos analíticos relacionados con la investigación y la observación y la innovación científicas marinas.]\n11\n(14.)

Whilst we support the inclusion of text for a definition of area-based management tools we note that the current version would need to exclude the bracketed text which states [providing higher protection than that provided in the surrounding areas]. The reason for this is that two (or more) area based management areas may be adjacent to one another and thus they cannot all provide higher protection. A more focussed solution to this is proposed below. “Area-based management tool” means a tool through which one or several sectors or activities are managed within a geographically defined area, with the aim of achieving\n17\nparticular conservation and sustainable use objectives [, that result in higher protection than that provided outside of such defined areas]. 6.

      "text" : "1(1) It is problematic to see multiple definitions of DSI in different fora. In order to ensure that this process is aligned with the CBD DSI process, the definition of “Associated data” could be determined by the decision-making body at a later date. 1(3) The ABMT definition should be more closely aligned with the CBD art. 8 which focuses on a broad range of measures to promote in situ conservation of nature. 1(4) ABNJ is not defined in UNCLOS and should not be defined in this text. UNCLOS defines the marine areas that are subject to varying levels of national jurisdiction; what remains is beyond national jurisdiction. Accordingly, a definition adds nothing to the term itself. On the other hand, this definition omits air space, which is referenced in UNCLOS (e.g., art. 78(1), 87(b), 135, 212(1), and which should therefore be included if ABNJ is defined. 1(6) It is important that “cumulative impacts” be “cumulative” across different uses (within a sector or across sectors) at any time as well as over time. The wording of the draft article is confusing because it refers to climate change and acidification as activities, which they are not. These are “impacts” themselves even if they have (cascading) consequences. 1(9) The definition of MGR follows the CBD (art. 2) where one definition relies on another one. Consolidating the definition is more straightforward and simple and avoids the problem of defining actual or potential value. Defining in terms of “utilization” allows better differentiation between commodities and genetic resources. It is still compatible with the CBD definition. 1(10) The definition of “MPA” should be consistent with the IUCN definition to ensure comparable reporting in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and compatible protection standards within and beyond national jurisdictions. (IUCN WCPA, 2018). Most important elements are persistence (long term) and a primary objective of conservation. Activities should be managed consistently with that objective (IUCN WCPA 2019). 1(11)/1(14) 1(11) “marine technology” and 1(14) “transfer of marine technology” should be better linked. For example, in the definition of ‘marine technology transfer’ [14] reference should be made to expertise. The draft definition of “marine technology” reflects the IOC Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology and therefore has a focus on\n23\nmarine sciences and related services. While these forms of technology will be important for the BBNJ agreement, other relevant forms of technology (such as monitoring, control and surveillance technologies) may not be currently captured in the definition. The definition could be made broader. 1(13) The draft definition of SEA describes the process of an SEA but does not provide a definition of an SEA. Moreover, in the draft text, there is no difference between EIA and SEA definitions, except that in SEA, the text refers to the details of the structure (scope) and process (participation, etc.) which apply also (but are not described) in the EIA paragraph above. The integrated aspect of SEA should be emphasized. Suggested additional terms to define: In addition to “sustainable use” it would be helpful to include definitions for “science-based”, “best available science”, “ecosystem approaches”, “precautionary approach/principle”. These appear under art. 5 (General principles and approaches) but it would be an opportunity to clarify and unify terminology (e.g. refer to CBD COP Decision V/6)"

      "text" : "Article 1, Use of Terms → Definitions of “marine genetic material” and “marine genetic resources” are open to interpretation The draft text currently includes definitions of “marine genetic material” and “marine genetic resources”: [8. “Marine genetic material” means any material of marine plant, animal, microbial or other origin containing functional units of heredity] [9.Alt. 1.“Marine genetic resources” means any material of marine plant, animal, microbial or other origin, [found in or] originating from areas beyond national jurisdiction and containing functional units of heredity with actual or potential value of their genetic and biochemical properties.] [9.Alt. 2.“Marine genetic resources” means marine genetic material of actual or potential value.] Ensuring that such definitions align with those under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol has merit. However, as noted in the DOSI commentary on the first draft text of the BBNJ agreement, these definitions are open to interpretation. Specifically, ‘functional units of heredity’, and ‘genetic and biochemical properties’ are ambiguous and require scientific clarity. Clarity on the meaning of “value” would help interpret the definition of marine genetic resources as per article 1 [9]. The value of marine genetic resources could be seen as scientific, educational, ecological, environmental, and cultural (DOSI 2019b). The meaning of “actual or\n24\npotential value” is ambiguous, in the absence of any other reference to value in the text. For example, the Forest Genetic Resources Plan (FAO, 2014) broadly defines genetic resources as genetic material of “actual or potential economic, environmental, scientific or societal value”. Similarly, the BBNJ agreement could make reference to the multiple dimensions of value. → Definitions of “marine technology” and “transfer of marine technology” may be too limited The draft text currently includes the following definition of marine technology: [11. “Marine technology” means information and data, provided in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services; manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials; sampling and methodology equipment; observation facilities and equipment (e.g., remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation); equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation; computer and computer software, including models and modelling techniques; and expertise, knowledge, skills, technical, scientific and legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation.] This definition reflects the 2005 IOC Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology and encompasses a broad range of equipment, knowledge, and information for marine scientific research. All of these forms of technology will be important for building capacity for the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ. However, this definition does not appear to cover all forms of technology relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ. For example, monitoring, control, and surveillance technologies could offer crucial tools for implementing the BBNJ agreement; some practitioners may not consider these tools as marine scientific research, thus placing them outside the scope of the present definition of marine technology. Other examples that may fall outside of the scope as currently defined include environmentally-sound technologies for sustainable use of BBNJ such as those for the conduct of environmental impact assessments, manage human activities involved with the acquisition or utilization of marine resources or decision-making support tools for spatial conservation planning. To “future-proof” this definition and avoid the need for an exhaustive list in the face of rapidly advancing techniques, the designation of appropriate technology could be a duty of the Scientific and Technical Body. However, if a list is incorporated into the text, we urge the inclusion of the following categories of useful tools / technologies: research submersibles, remotely operated and autonomous vehicles, camera sleds, seafloor samplers, equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation (including field-based genetic isolation, amplification, sequencing, and imaging technologies). → The draft text currently includes the following definition of ‘transfer of marine technology’: [14. “Transfer of marine technology” means the transfer of the instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean.]\n25\nThe current definition includes some, but not all, forms of technology referred to in the draft definition of technology at paragraph [11]. In particular, it excludes skills, expertise, or information. Consideration could be given to broadening the definition to include these additional elements. Furthermore, the reference to the transfer of technologies “required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean” may be overly restrictive because: (i) technologically-limited states might not produce knowledge but would make use of knowledge produced by others, and (ii) the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity may require more than improved study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean - but rather more proactive measures to monitor human activities, such as for the implementation of area-based management tools. In order to capture the full range of technologies potentially needed to enable the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ, this definition could be expanded, e.g: “Transfer of marine technology” means the transfer of the instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and/or use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and enable the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. → Strategic environmental assessment Strategic environmental assessments are an important tool for planning and could usefully advance scientific research and technology transfer. For this reason, paragraph [13] represents an important part of the draft BBNJ agreement, as does the reference to Strategic environmental assessments in Article 28. → Marine protected area The draft text currently provides the following draft definition of Marine Protected Area: 10. “Marine protected area” means a geographically defined marine area that is designated and managed to achieve specific [long-term biodiversity] conservation and sustainable use objectives [and that affords higher protection than the surrounding areas]. The text in square brackets would facilitate the conservation and sustainable use goals put forth elsewhere in the draft text. Marine protected can address a range of objectives (Day et al., 2012), however, fully protected marine reserves are demonstrably best for conserving biological diversity, as they protect communities and the ecological processes that sustain them from direct and indirect forms of human disturbance (Sala et al. 2018). Given the importance of connectivity in marine systems (DOSI, 2020), allowing for networks of protected areas that consider geographically distributed and/or shifting habitats and species distributions would be helpful in achieving a range of “conservation and sustainable use objectives.”\n26"

Por consiguiente, sería innecesaria la inclusión de esta cláusula en el instrumento.\n• Ahora bien, dicha salvaguarda se hace en el marco de disposiciones ambientales – protección y preservación del medio marino- y el instrumento BBNJ prevé una aplicación material más amplia (acceso y uso de recursos genéticos marinos, a los que no se hace alusión ni en la CONVEMAR ni en otros instrumentos sobre la navegación, seguridad de buques y de la vida humana en el mar).\nDado que una parte considerable de la investigación científica marina se realiza con buques estatales, la aceptación de tal artículo implicaría, por ejemplo, dejar fuera de la regulación del instrumento a las actividades relacionadas a los recursos genéticos marinos, el acceso a los mismos y el consecuente reparto de utilidades que se deriven por su acceso y utilización. Derivado de las consideraciones anteriores, CLAM solicita eliminar esta cláusula o en su caso, mantenerla en corchetes para su discusión en la cuarta conferencia y de ninguna manera darla por acordada como sugiere la versión revisada al dejarla sin corchetes. [English version] Article 3 Application 3.1. CLAM considers that the geographical scope of this instrument should be marine areas beyond national jurisdiction (in accordance with the content of the article 1.4), as stated in the latest draft of the binding instrument.\n33\n3.2. CLAM observes that this numeral refers to sovereign immunity for state vessels in terms of article 236 of UNCLOS. In this sense, CLAM wishes to call your attention to the following considerations:\n• Reference to sovereign immunity has no place in an article referring to the geographical application of the instrument.\n• During the Third Intergovernmental Conference there was NO consensus on including this clause. Several delegations, including CLAM, expressed objections about its content.\n• This jurisdictional immunity of vessels is already recognized, not only within the framework of UNCLOS but also by other treaties and regimes governing the oceans. Therefore, the presence of this clause in the BBNJ instrument is unnecessary.\n• This legal protection is made within the framework of environmental provisions - protection and preservation of the marine environment - and the BBNJ instrument provides for a broader material application (access and use of marine genetic resources, to which no reference is made either in UNCLOS or other instruments on navigation, ship safety and human life at sea).\nGiven that a considerable part of marine scientific research is carried out by state vessels, the acceptance of such an article would imply, for example, not considering the activities related to marine genetic resources, their access and the consequent distribution of benefits from access and utilization. In terms of the abovementioned, CLAM requests to eliminate this clause or, where appropriate, keep it in square brackets for further discussion during the fourth conference. In no circumstance this article 3.2 shall be considered as accepted and agreed by the delegations as it is suggested in the revised text by not keeping the square brackets."

      "text" : "Artículo 4 Relación entre el presente Acuerdo y la Convención y los instrumentos y marcos jurídicos pertinentes y los órganos mundiales, regionales, subregionales y sectoriales competentes CLAM prefiere el uso de la palabra competentes en lugar de existentes, en tanto que la primera tiene un alcance más amplio que permite la inclusión de otros instrumentos, organismos y marcos no solo existentes o en vigor actualmente, sino aquellos que puedan surgir en el futuro. BBNJ debe permitir la armonización legislativa y la participación de otros instrumentos y organismos internacionales para garantizar que no exista una sobrerregulación o interferencia en otras jurisdicciones y ámbitos de aplicación. Este tratado debe procurar la complementariedad e integralidad en la aplicación a través de la cooperación dispuesta en el artículo 6. La negociación de BBNJ está basada, entre otros principios, en el de cooperación entre los instrumentos existentes en áreas fuera de la jurisdicción y en el de no socavar las competencias de estos. Lo anterior se deberá ver claramente reflejado en los artículos 4 y 6, buscando articular los mecanismos ya existentes con la nueva institucionalidad de BBNJ. BBNJ debe respetar los derechos de jurisdicción y deberes de los Estados Ribereños derivados de la Convención, de manera compatible con ella y el régimen jurídico aplicable. Adicionalmente se debe garantizar el estatus jurídico de los Estados no CONVEMAR, que no podrá ser afectado por las disposiciones del instrumento BBNJ, de conformidad con el carácter universal del tratado. (2) CLAM solicita la eliminación de las referencias a áreas geográficas específicas:\nArtículo 4.2. Los derechos y la jurisdicción de los Estados ribereños en todas las zonas bajo su jurisdicción nacional, [incluida la plataforma continental dentro de las 200 millas marinas y más allá y la zona económica exclusiva,] se respetarán de conformidad con la Convención.\nLo anterior por cuanto no es competencia de este instrumento la definición de límites o alcances de los espacios marítimos. (3) CLAM considera que la clave para cumplir el mandato de no menoscabar, recae en el respeto pleno de las competencias de los foros, organismos e instrumentos pertinentes. En ese sentido se sugiere mantener la referencia fuera de los corchetes para quedar de la siguiente manera:\nArtículo 4.3. El presente Acuerdo se interpretará y aplicará de manera que respete las competencias y no menoscabe los instrumentos y marcos jurídicos pertinentes ni de los órganos mundiales, regionales, subregionales y sectoriales competentes.\n38\n(4) Finalmente, CLAM está de acuerdo con mantener el artículo 4.4 que reitera la universalidad del instrumento de conformidad con lo establecido en las Resoluciones 69/292 y 72/249 y en consecuencia solicita retirar los corchetes de esta cláusula. [English version] Article 4. Relationship between this Agreement and the Convention and relevant legal instruments and frameworks and relevant global, regional, subregional and sectoral bodies CLAM prefers the use of the word relevant rather than existing, as it provides for a broader scope than the organisms, bodies and instruments currently in force, and allows a future relationship with those that may arise at some point. BBNJ should allow legislative harmonization and the participation of other international instruments and organizations to ensure that there is no over-regulation or interference in other jurisdictions or competences. This treaty should ensure complementarity and comprehensiveness in accordance to article 6 on cooperation. BBNJ's negotiation is based, among others, on the cooperation between existing instruments in areas beyond the jurisdiction and on the not undermining of competences principle. This principle should be clearly reflected in articles 4 and 6, for the interest of an effective articulation between the existing mechanisms and the new institutional organization of BBNJ. BBNJ shall harmoniously observe the sovereign rights, jurisdiction and duties of the coastal States as stated in the Convention, in terms of the applicable legal regime. Furthermore, the legal status of non-UNCLOS States shall be guaranteed in terms of the universal nature of the treaty. Such non-UNCLOS status shall not be affected by the provisions of the BBNJ instrument. 4.2. CLAM requests the removal of references to specific geographic areas as it is not on BBNJ jurisdiction to outline the limits or scope of maritime spaces:\nArticle 4.2 The rights and jurisdiction of coastal States in all areas under national jurisdiction, including the continental shelf within and beyond 200 nautical miles and the exclusive economic zone, shall be respected in accordance with the Convention. 4.3. CLAM considers that the key for achieving the mandate of not undermining is to fully observe the competencies of the relevant forums, organisms and instruments. In that sense it is suggested to keep the reference to such competencies in the text as follows:\nArticle 4.3 This Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that [respects the competences of and] does not undermine relevant legal instruments and frameworks and relevant global, regional, subregional and sectoral bodies.\n4.4. Finally, CLAM agrees to maintain article 4.4, echoing the universality of the instrument in accordance with the provisions of Resolutions 69/292 and 72/249. Therefore, CLAM requests to remove the square brackets of this clause.\n39\n."

Similar positions have been presented by several other States in the negotiations. As this option is not adequately reflected in the current draft, Iceland hereby presents the following proposal for draft language. The proposal is based on a proposal presented by Norway earlier in the process, with a few amendments and additions to the original Norwegian proposal. As this approach would result in decision making regarding ABMTs and EIAs being at the regional level, it would follow that there would not be a need to include language in the Agreement relating to several points, including adopting at a global level decisions on individual ABMTs or EIAs nor regarding a global Scientific and Technical Body. In order to accommodate different views, Iceland is willing to discuss the possibility of these provisions being maintained in some form, with their scope of application being limited to regions where no regional consultation process is in place. Amendments from the original Norwegian proposal are highlighted in the following text.\nArticle 6 International cooperation\nNew para 4\n4. International cooperation regarding Parts III and IV of this Agreement shall be conducted in the following manner:\n53\na) States Parties shall establish regional consultation processes to enhance cooperation and coordination among relevant international legal instruments and frameworks and relevant global, regional, subregional and sectoral bodies and coordination among associated conservation and management measures adopted under such instruments and frameworks and by such bodies.\nb) Relevant international legal instruments and frameworks and global, regional and sectoral bodies with competence under international law to control human activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction, including intergovernmental organizations for the protection of the marine environment, regional fisheries management organizations, the International Maritime Organization, the International Seabed Authority, shall, as appropriate, participate in regional consultation processes established pursuant to this Article.\nc) The participants in the regional consultation process shall formalise the processes either as a formal international body or by giving one of the participants the role of administrating and coordinating the work of the process including organising meetings and reporting to the Conference of the Parties.\nd) States Parties shall work through relevant legal instruments and frameworks and\nrelevant global, regional, subregional and sectoral bodies to adopt measures regarding area-based management tools, including marine protected areas and environmental impact assessments in line with Parts III and IV of this Agreement.\ne) Where there is no regional body with a mandate to establish conservation and\nmanagement measures to protect biodiversity from specific human activities in ABNJ, particularly if there is evidence that the biodiversity may be under threat or where a new activity is being developed, relevant coastal States and States operating in adjacent areas beyond national jurisdiction in the region shall cooperate to establish such a body to ensure conservation and sustainable use of such biodiversity and shall participate in the work of the body. Pending agreement on such bodies, States shall observe the provisions of this Agreement and shall act in good faith and with due regard to the rights, interests and duties of other States.\nf) When a regional body has been established pursuant to subparagraph (e), States\noperating in areas beyond national jurisdiction and relevant coastal States shall give effect to their duty to cooperate by becoming members of such body or by agreeing to apply the conservation and management measures established by such body. States having a real interest in the activities concerned may become members of such body. The terms of participation in such body shall not preclude such States from membership; nor shall they be applied in a manner which discriminates against any State or group of States having a real interest in the activities concerned.\n54\ng) Any State intending to propose that action be taken by a regional body having competence with respect to biodiversity should, where such action would have a significant effect on conservation and management measures already established by a competent intergovernmental body, consult through that body with its members. To the extent practicable, such consultation should take place prior to the submission of the proposal to the intergovernmental body."

This article does not engage directly with the issue of information sharing with regards to MSR and the delay that could be involved while a patent application is being prepared. There is no reference to time. If a patent is granted, there will need to have been a sharing of information at some point. More concerning is the prospect of the choice to keep information a trade secret. One option to address this is to establish a period during which secrecy is permitted and after which information must be available to all. A disclosure within this period may be permitted (in line with public interest defences) if the information is used to contribute to ecologically sustainable practices. (see comment on art. 45)."

If the intention is to allow for notification of coastal States, or to provide information (etc…), this could be more clearly spelled out, with due regard as a backstop. It may be best to leave it so that whichever jurisdiction the actual material was obtained from is applied. 9(3) This could raise a patent issue if there were to be direct patenting of MGR, but even the loosest application of patent law should not lead to this. It could depend on what is meant by appropriation – e.g. setting on one a path to an innovation, although that is not the standard meaning and is likely not what is meant here. 9(4) Is not inconsistent with the existence of patents building on MGR as development and sharing of innovation can be consistent with the benefit of all (eventually) 9(5) This provision may be difficult to monitor and enforce.

Commentary: 10(1) This provision should include prior notification of listed items with an update post cruise.\n10(2)(c) Private IP rights over relevant technology could restrict the effective transfer of marine technology - reference could be made to TRIPS art. 9, 30 and 31 that provide exceptions and compulsory licensing provisions, in particular regarding ongoing research by anyone for any purpose and the sharing of patents for use for energy transitions or ecologically sustainable products. This would not remove all reliance on rights, depending on the activity or the need for some payment but it would engage directly with the issue. Silence on this matter in UNFCCC agreements has been unproductive, and challenges remain at WTO and UNFCCC regarding the\n81\npower of intellectual property (see Brown monograph 2019 Intellectual Property, Climate Change and Technology, in particular ch. 1). See wording from CBD (and TRIPS above) (and see IUCN contribution on art 12 at end IGC 3 but note that the reference there to restrictions in the context of plant life, human life, avoiding serious prejudice to the environment is quite wide.\n10(2)(d) What is meant by open source? Does this mean functionally accessible and interoperable or does it mean free of charge or free of restriction as to onward use? There may be claims that information submitted to the banks, etc. is secret, that collections of such data are subject to database rights and that a software which operates for banks, etc. currently or in the future is subject to a patent. This could restrict the workability of this solution. Benefit sharing: combining intellectual property, trade secrets, science and an ecosystem focused approach, edited collection from Malmo conference May 2019).\n• This provision may be better used in the benefit sharing section. • A formal definition of the terms (open access, open source…) should clarify the provision. Another issue arises from the common practice of providers of material requesting a handling charge to send materials reducing the burden on them.\n10(3) There is a lack of clarity with regards to the definition of free and open (see comments on art. 10(2)(d) above).\n10(4) Providing for access to DSI is critical to prevent fragmentation of databases. The value rests with the collection of information, not individual sequences.\n10(5) This section is highly problematic. In case of conflict, it is unclear where the burden of proof would lie. If one develops a product from an MGR found in ABNJ and that it is subsequently found in the EEZ of a coastal state, will they have to share benefits? The same problem arises when something found in an MGR from an ABNJ is also found in a terrestrial species in a landlocked state. This is inapplicable. The whole issue of adjacency and rights of coastal States is irrelevant. The jurisdiction where the GR is found should govern how benefit sharing is applied."

      "text" : "Article 10, ‘Collection’ / ‘Access’ → Pre-cruise notification Prior notification would be broadly consistent with scientific best practice (Rabone et al., 2019), thereby avoiding unnecessary hindrances to scientific research activities while delivering transparency. Much of this information is already made publicly available on national Research Vessel Planning websites - a clearinghouse could make such information more easily discoverable and streamline international best practice approaches. However, a permit or license scheme, especially for in situ collection of samples for marine genetic resources, would require resources and an institutional mechanism to review proposals and make decisions. There are concerns that this could be overly restrictive and cause delays.\n82\n→ Post-cruise notification (In situ collection of or access to MGR) [2.States Parties shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, to ensure that in situ[collection of] [access to] marine genetic resources within the scope of this Part shall be subject to: (a) An indication of the geographical coordinates of the location where marine genetic resources were [collected] [accessed]; After sample collection, it would be useful to include more than just geographical coordinates in the reporting platform.

Both of these terms should be defined in order to clarify their intended meaning and enable informed decision-making - currently the term “collection” is not defined. One interpretation is that collection means ‘in situ’ access and physical recovery, such as collecting a sample containing marine genetic material from the high seas. However, without collection, there can be no other forms of access. A further possible point of confusion is that “collection” also means repository of samples (e.g. a museum collection, scientific reference collection).\n83\nARTICLE 10BIS"

      "text" : "11(1) It is important to emphasize that benefits should be shared in a fair and equitable manner. Art. 11(2) is not necessary, given art. 11(3). It will be important to make clear decisions about what monetary and non-monetary benefits are covered and how. 11(3)(a) The rate of payments of monetary benefits could be determined by the COP. The ILBI could specify that different rates must be determined by nature of use of MGR (e.g. lower if products encourage sustainable activity). This would set down a marker consistent with fair and equitable benefit sharing and with overall principles, and also with 11(4), while still leaving details to be discussed and adopted at the COP. Benefit sharing: combining intellectual property, trade secrets, science and an ecosystem-focused approach, chapter to edited collection from Malmo conference May 2019).). Since both monetary and non-monetary benefits cost money, the true cost of ‘non-monetary benefits’ should be recognised and factored in any calculations on levels of benefit provided. 11(3)(a)/11(3)(b) DSI can be shared without loss of materials, whereas MGR are limited and may be collected for specific research project. Therefore, an embargo on physical MGR makes more sense than an embargo for DSI. Sharing of MGR should be based on availability, suitability of material and non-competing use. 11(3)(b) seems to cover this better (current international practice in the field).\n96\n11(3)(b) See comments under art. 10(2)(d) above on open access\n11(4) This provision is really positive. It will be important to find ways to monitor these benefits and ensure that their value is factored into benefit calculations. Art. 11(5) needs to ensure that this information is not kept by each State, but shared via a clearing house mechanism in order to ensure transparency. This open clause could be seen as enabling States to rely on provision from TRIPS discussed in comments on art. 10(2)(c) above."

This wording could work or it could be seen as ensuring a maximalist approach to IP and there could be reluctance to pursue flexibilities in TRIPS because of fear as to approaches which would be better. It would be preferable to opt for clarity.\nThere is a lot of scholarship on this in the domain of health, see e.g. Carlos Correa, 2000; Carlos Correa, 2002; Daniel J. Gervais, ‘Trips 3.0: Policy Calibration and Innovation Displacement’ in Chantal Thomas and Joel P Trachtman (eds), Developing Countries in the WTO Legal System (Oxford University Press, New York, 2009) and Abdulqawi (eds, 3 ed) Intellectual Property and International Trade: The TRIPS Agreement (Wolters Kluwer, Netherlands, 2016).\n12(2) The first sentence of this provision repeats internationally accepted limits on patenting. There is a concern that a requirement that there must be disclosure of origin to get a patent, then this is a new ground for validity and this would be moving beyond the requirements of TRIPS. The presumption avoids concerns that a new requirement for validity would be imposed, (which would be inconsistent with TRIPS) and does not create a new procedural requirement (which could be problematic under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (see Chiarolla, 2018). For this to work, however, there needs to be a link between this and the benefit sharing provisions (art. 11) and this point may be better made there.\n12(3) This provision links to the legal issues highlighted in comments to art. 12(2). There could\n100\nbe a requirement that States do it, many already do (see WIPO, disclosure requirements table) and research shows it would not be expensive (see Castalia (2018). Economic Evaluation of Disclosure of Origin Requirements).\nA focus on users and collection of information elsewhere could be a different solution but this may be practically difficult. If patent offices are seen as the easiest way of collecting this for all use and not only for patents (reference to users is important), this could be made clear. Patent offices could just be a collection house rather than there being any link with patent law. The disclosure of origin could be introduced at national level to meet requirements under Nagoya and it could be delivered in patent offices. This must not, however, be linked with the validity of there being a patent.\n12(3)(a) Disclosure of origin is essential to show you did not obtain material from AWNJ so you do not have to comply with the NP.\n12(3)(b) Would be a problem under TRIPS.\n101\nARTICLE 13"

Based on rapidly developing science, especially in the marine and genetic resources, it is solid to argue that genetic resources taken from fish has the potential for a significant economical value.2\n2. Indonesia notes that the genetic potential of certain fishes has been widely used for fisheries aquaculture development activities in many places. It is also certain to be increasingly developed in the future. The possibility of fish becoming one of the main pillars of aquaculture and used or marine scientific research purposes in the future is undoubtedly very high.3\n3. Fish that live in high seas, in the depths of the ocean underwater volcanoes, and other extreme deep sea environments store powerful genetic potential for medicine. Examples include deep sea fish oil as candidate treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Many publications suggest that deep sea biological resources as potential ingredients for novel-anticancer drugs.4\n4. Fish is considered as an essential marine genetic resource that is very useful in determining ecosystem stability in marine and coastal areas.5 The existence of large number of fish in the ecosystem is also used to as a very crucial indicator to the climate change.6 This indication can support the global research on the climate change through genetic and material genetic approach.7\n2 Anake Kijjoa and Pichan Sawangwong, Drugs and Cosmetics from the Sea, Marine Drugs Vol. 2(2) (2004) https://doi.org/10.3390/md202073; Refik Tanakol (et. al), Fatty Acid Composition of 19 Species of Fish from the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, Lipids Vol. 34(3) (1999) https://doi.org/10.1007/s11745-999-0366-8; Ane Jorem and Morten Walloe Tvedt, Bioprospecting in the High Seas: Existing Rights and Obligations in View of a New Legal Regime for Marine Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, The International Journal of Marine and Coastal Law Vol. 29(4) (2014) https://doi.org/10.1163/15718085-12341319; Gorka Merino (et. al), Can Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture Meet Fish Demand from a Growing Human Population in a Changing Climate?, Global Environmental Change Vol. 22(4) (2012) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.03.003) 3 J.

Archipelagic states, as Indonesia, are very rich of endemic species and highly migratory fish such as Latimeria menadoensis,8 Hemiscyllium halmahera,9 Anguilla boorneensis endemic to Kalimantan Island and being ancestral to eels,10 highly migratory fish being closely related to eels (genus Anguilla),11 and tuna (genus Thunnus).12 This unique characteristic cannot be found in other coastal areas and become a strong attraction to the researchers globally to unlock the unfound potential in research and technology that would be used not only for economical purposes but also humanity and peace purposes.13 It is undeniable that fish, in the largest world laboratory such as archipelagic states,14 need to be strongly governed in the dimension of ILBI BBNJ.\n6. Indonesia is of the view that the regulation of fish as part of the MGR in the ILBI BBNJ will not lead to complications in regulating the status of fish within the area beyond national jurisdiction. In fact, a complete arrangement in terms of fish as a commodity product both with the regulation on fish as an MGR will provide a strong certainty in the future for the management of fisheries. A complete arrangement will eliminate the presence of gray areas of fish caught for consumption reasons but lead to bioprospecting activities. Indonesia believes that this interest is also shared by most of coastal States and archipelagic States in the world.\n7. Furthermore, Indonesia noted and respected various concerns that regulating fish as part of the MGR would cause difficulties at the level of implementation in the field, specifically how to sort or monitor fish caught for commodity consumption or for bioprospecting. In this regard, Indonesia is of the view that these concerns are answered by ensuring a comprehensive clearing house mechanism and traceability mechanism through the ILBI BBNJ.\n8. The discussion on the threshold of the number of fish caught for consumption or bioprospecting commodities becomes invalid when a rigid tracebility is formed together. It is a fact that for the sake of bioporospecting fish, it does not always require a large number of specimens, it even requires only a small portion of fish, or even for some purposes, the genetic / fish DNA can be obtained from only taking a few samples from the living environment.\nAquatic Toxicology Vol. 22(4) (1992) https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-445X(92)90046-P; Vidar Berg (et.

      "text" : "A fundamental requirement for achieving the objectives set out in the Draft Treaty is the facilitation of research, including research that utilises MGRs. ICC therefore supports references to the facilitation and promotion of marine scientific research in the Draft Treaty. Such research, itself a sustainable use of MGRs, contributes to advancing scientific knowledge and understanding of oceans, and particularly that of the high seas and sea beds in areas beyond national jurisdiction which is limited compared to terrestrial and coastal environments.\nBusiness investments in research and development (R&D) can also contribute to advancing scientific knowledge by generating new information, technologies and technological advancements. R&D for commercial purposes may include the utilisation of MGRs, although the use of MGRs from areas beyond national jurisdiction is currently limited. The outcomes of private investment in R&D can therefore contribute to our scientific understanding of the oceans, which in turn supports the objectives of the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity.\nICC is concerned that certain elements currently included in the Draft Treaty could have farreaching application and a negative impact on R&D. There is the potential for the creation of encumbrances on R&D that utilises MGRs that will disproportionately increase costs, create unworkable administrative burdens, and increase uncertainty. These are disincentives for investment and innovation by the business community, as well as for public and private research\n109\nactivities with MGRs. These concerns are not unfounded – encumbrances imposed by the Nagoya Protocol of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)15 have had the inadvertent effect of discouraging both public and private R&D activities that could contribute to its objectives of the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.16,17\nICC recognises that certain elements of the Draft Treaty are intended to address concerns expressed by some countries that they are not able to participate in or benefit from R&D and other research activities related to marine biological diversity in their own waters or in adjacent high seas. These concerns could be more effectively addressed by supporting and encouraging training, capacity building, and research collaborations, rather than through mandatory obligations that would create disincentives for research and innovation using MGRs."

      "heading" : "SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH ELEMENTS OF THE DRAFT NEGOTIATING TEXT",
      "text" : "The Draft Treaty proposes several encumbrances on R&D with MGRs that create disincentives for investment by the business community. This would have detrimental impacts on the development of new innovative products with broad societal benefits, and on the objectives of the Draft Treaty, as there are outcomes of private investment in R&D that contribute to advancing our scientific knowledge and capabilities. To create a regime that is broadly supportive of these interests, ICC cautions against the inclusion of several elements set out below.\n• Mandatory monetary benefit sharing and technology transfer: the substantial investments made in R&D in time, finances and other resources for the development of new innovative products and technologies are often overlooked in discussions on benefit sharing, which focus on the monetary value of the expected commercial product. These discussions also overlook the substantial risks involved for developers. While the aim is to eventually generate revenue, there is no guarantee of success with any product development endeavor (including those that involve MGRs) as they can have long timelines, low commercial success rates, and low margins even where success rates are high. These realities have in fact generated frustration and misunderstanding under the Nagoya Protocol and would likely have the same result in relation to MGR. Conversely, there may be more immediate value in the non- monetary benefits arising from private investment in R&D involving MGRs, e.g. the information and technology generated reach the public in a variety of ways, with these having potential application in different areas of scientific investigation, including research on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity. With regard to technology transfer, it should be borne in mind that the ability of a country to use technology depends on its absorptive capacity, including a work force with the\n15 Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation to the Convention on Biological Diversity. In force 12 Oct 2014, 122 Parties. 16 For example, public scientists have publicly acknowledged the limitations placed upon their conservation research efforts by the costs, administrative burden and uncertainty associated with genetic resources under the Nagoya Protocol. 17 See: K. Divakaran Prathapan, Rohan Pethiyagoda, Kamaljit S. Bawa, Peter H. Raven, Priyadarsanan Dharma Rajan and 172 cosignatories from 35 countries (2018) When the Cure Kills – CBD Limits Biodiversity Research. Science 360:1405-1406. DOI: 10.1126/science.aat9844.\n110\nrelevant technological skills, and necessary infrastructure and equipment.18 To build technological capacity and create an environment that supports local research and innovation, investments have to be made in the necessary infrastructure, skills building and long-term collaborations. Mandatory obligations to transfer technology will not achieve the aims of building local technological capacity and will instead discourage investment and partnerships which could contribute to this objective.\nConsequently, we caution against the imposition of obligations to share monetary benefits and transfer technology in the Draft Treaty.\n• Measures that impact intellectual property rights or their value: the Draft Treaty potentially creates new disclosure obligations for patent applications, and limits patent acquisitions and enforcement options.19 The text should not impose requirements or restrictions that are incompatible with established intellectual property systems. These systems aim to promote innovation, which involves substantial investment of resources and risk. Such changes would create significant disincentives for investment in R&D involving marine genetic resources and could therefore in fact negatively impact conservation and sustainable use of those resources. • Application beyond utilisation of marine genetic resources accessed in situ The Draft Treaty is potentially broadly inclusive of MGRs collected or accessed in situ, accessed ex situ or in silico (which is interpreted to be inclusive of the alternative terms of digital/genetic sequence data/and information) and their utilization,20 with benefit sharing potentially arising from any or all of these activities.21 Such broad application would create significant legal uncertainty and an unworkable, time-consuming and costly administrative burden, which in turn would have a significantly negative impact on the use of MGRs in R&D and the benefits that this investment could provide. ICC emphasizes that the text should apply only to the utilisation of physical marine genetic resources accessed in situ, and it should not include MGRs accessed ex situ, or to information or data obtained from MGRs.\nWith regard to information (referred to in the Draft Treaty as digital/genetic sequence data/and information, or within the broader term in silico), ICC has made submissions to the Convention on Biological Diversity on the topic of “digital sequence information”22 where it has expressed concern about the negative implications for including such information within the scope of benefit sharing regimes. Unencumbered access to this information is essential for achieving the objectives of the CBD, which are analogous to the objectives of the Draft Treaty: the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Such access is also essential for the broader goals of the advancement of scientific knowledge, which is of particular importance for areas beyond national jurisdiction where\n18 See “The Dynamics of Global Technology and Knowledge Flows” by Jennifer Brant and Balaji Parthasarathy (ICC Innovation and Intellectual Property series) at https://iccwbo.org/publication/the-dynamics-of-global-technology-andknowledge-flows/. 19 Part II, Article 12, paragraphs 1-3. 20 Part I, Article 1, paragraph 1; Part II, Article 8, paragraphs 1-2. 21 Part II, Article 7, paragraph (a). 22 See: https://www.cbd.int/abs/DSI-views/2019/ICC-DSI.pdf (2019); https://www.cbd.int/abs/DSI-views/ICCDSI.pdf (2017); https://iccwbo.org/content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/ICC-IP-position-paper-on-digital-sequenceinformation.pdf (2016).\n111\nthis knowledge is currently limited, and an open access culture is critical to ethical and responsible research. Towards this, ICC emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the current scientific practice of open access and exchange of such information is maintained. It also emphasizes that information that is currently in the public domain must remain freely accessible – this view is supported by a broad range of stakeholders including public sector organisations, scientific and academic institutions, data repositories and collections.23\n• Retroactive application on access or use/utilisation: the Draft Treaty creates the potential for retroactive application to MGRs collected or accessed in situ before its entry into force, then accessed ex situ or in silico (or as digital/genetic sequence data/and information) or utilised after its entry into force.24 Again, such broad application creates an unworkable situation, with significant legal uncertainty and administrative burden, and disincentives for the use of MGRs in R&D. The text should only apply to physical marine genetic resources accessed in situ after the treaty enters into force.\n23 See the Joint Stakeholder Statement, “Promoting Sustainable Use and Conservation of Biological Diversity through Open Exchange of Digital Sequence Information”; available at: https://iccwbo.org/publication/promoting-sustainableuse-conservation-biodiversity-openexchange-digital-sequence-information/. 24 Part II, Article 8, paragraph 3.\n112\nPART III25 MEASURES SUCH AS AREA-BASED MANAGEMENT TOOLS,\nINCLUDING MARINE PROTECTED AREAS\n25 Note by the secretariat: General comments made by delegations on Part III are included at the end of this Part.\n113"

A monitoring plan will be essential in deciding whether the conservation objectives are achieved and will feed into the review. The time frame for this monitoring plan should be based on the best available science related to the lifespans of the target organisms and other species that will be impacted by the activities. For example, if the target organism exclusively inhabits deep-sea coral reefs, then the appropriate monitoring program will be on the scale of decades. Should the monitoring plan indicate that the targets of the selected indicators are not met and consequently the conservation objectives will also not be met, a process can be triggered to review activities that may be posing a threat to BBNJ. Monitoring plans will need to be designed to take into account natural variability in the system, as well as long-term changes due to external stressors such as climate change. The use of long-term monitoring locations as reference sites, as well as control sites monitored repeatedly inside and outside MPAs are some of the approaches to consider. The research plan should address critical gaps in the knowledge on which the monitoring plan is based (such as the age and growth rates of the target species) or scientific hypotheses that need to be fulfilled (such as habitat use and fidelity)."

      "text" : "51(2) There are a number of existing platforms that provide access to scientific and technical ocean information; their users and hosts have suggested that a single may not be the most functional approach. It is similarly critical that the clearinghouse mechanism includes a human element, e.g., for providing assistance and training on use of said web-based platforms. 51(2) The term ‘open access’ is unclear and key questions will need to be addressed to make this a functional system. For example, is this free of charge/ use for any purposes or just noncommercial purposes? Addressing this point would cover points arising from substance of information to be delivered under 51(3)(b). There are a lot of existing platforms and they are hard to locate and use. The most important opportunity of the Clearing house is to make information findable, accessible and usable; and to enable community-wide engagement in information exchange. 51(3) It would be useful to have a catch-all clause such as \"any other information that the COP may determine necessary\". 51(3)(b) Utilise existing databases rather than developing new ones. Ensure identifier is associated with each database entry to allow traceability. Full track and trace will be difficult to achieve, hence traceability via a unique identifier may be the best option.\n343\n51(3)(c) Make sure that the actual value of ‘non-monetary benefit sharing’ is factored into this so it is accounted for. 51(3)(d) The Clearing House Mechanism is needed to provide a central access point for notices of activities subject to screening and/or EIA, for submission of public comments, and for final EIAs. The centralized information provided by the Clearing House Mechanism can be used in preparing EIAs to reduce effort, cost, and time by avoiding duplication and facilitating access to information. The same resources will be valuable for cumulative effects analysis, as will the information referred to in (b) and (c). The Clearing House Mechanism can also provide technical support for national capacity to implement EIA obligations. 51(3)(f) See Minas, S. (2018).

This issue is discussed in relation to specific articles above. It is really important that in the same way that information can not be the subject of wide IP claims, it is not to be the subject of unchallenged and unjustified claims to confidentiality. “Due regard” to confidentiality of information could be appropriate. If there is a more direct engagement with IP in 51(2) then this could pick up the confidentiality point in more depth, making clear that not all claims to confidentiality need and should always be respected (see comment on art. 45(2) above referring to the secrecy period). On the other hand, “due regard” could be seen as having inherent limits in it and if there is engagement with IP in this section the confidentiality provision could be argued to come within the same limits."

      "heading" : "Core Latin American Group",
      "text" : "Parte VI Arreglos Institucionales En términos generales, los arreglos institucionales deben de cumplir con: 1) relación costobeneficio; 2) evitar la duplicidad de procesos, la extrema burocratización de los mismos y la incompatibilidad con la aplicación y cumplimiento de otros instrumentos y organismos; y 3) favorecer la toma de decisiones de forma ágil y procurando el consenso. La administración y funcionamiento de BBNJ implica la operación de órganos o instancias políticas, administrativas y técnico-científicas, que faciliten consensos políticos y acceso a la mejor ciencia disponible para la toma de decisiones. Se debe pensar en esquemas de discusión que favorezcan la toma de decisiones de manera expedita y que, en la medida de lo posible, se favorezca la especialización e idoneidad en los órganos científicos. CLAM apoya la creación de una institucionalidad propia del instrumento, que como mínimo cuente con una Conferencia de las Partes, una Secretaría, un Órgano Científico y Técnico y además incluir un mecanismo de intercambio de información (clearing-house). Es fundamental el establecimiento de un Fondo Especial para la repartición de beneficios monetarios de la utilización de recursos genéticos marinos. Asignar las funciones y objetivos del instrumento a órganos ya existentes no se considera conveniente por la magnitud y el alcance de lo regulado en el tratado, que excede las competencias de las instituciones ya existentes, incluidas aquellas creadas por CONVEMAR. No obstante, se considera importante establecer un mecanismo de participación de dichos órganos para garantizar la complementariedad y el respeto de competencias. Sobre su funcionamiento, es importante que el instrumento sea claro en cuanto a las facultades de cada órgano y que se tengan presentes medidas de coordinación y cooperación con otros instrumentos que puedan tener alguna implicación con este acuerdo. De igual forma, CLAM favorece la creación de un órgano científico, como un ente asesor del órgano decisorio que debe ser la COP. También es conveniente la creación de un mecanismo de intercambio de información (clearing house) administrado por la Secretaría, que facilite el acceso a la información, la transparencia y la publicidad a través de, principalmente, una plataforma web. Para CLAM es importante incluir en el instrumento la convocatoria a una Conferencia de Revisión del instrumento cada cinco años. Asimismo, deben incluirse disposiciones sobre financiamiento, sobre la base de que estas pueden ser voluntarias y obligatorias.\n346\n[English version] Part VI. Institutional Arrangements In a general sense, institutional arrangements must: 1) be driven by the cost-benefit principle; 2) avoid duplicity of processes, their excessive bureaucracy and incompatibility with the implementation and compliance with other instruments and organizations; 3) enable an agile decision-making process that aims to achieve consensus. The functioning of BBNJ calls for the operation of political, administrative, technical and scientific bodies, that simplify political consensus as well as access to the best available science for decision making. BBNJ must consider discussion mechanisms that favor expeditious decision making (i.e. taking into account the MGR access scheme for private actors and research activities, as well as environmental emergencies). It should also, as far as practicable, encourage specialization and suitability in the scientific and technical bodies. CLAM is in favor of creating dedicated institutions for BBNJ. Those institutions should consist of, at the minimum, a Conference of the Parties, a Secretariat and a Scientific and Technical Body. CLAM believes that the assignment of functions and objectives of the instrument to other existing bodies is not appropriate, given the magnitude and scope of the issues regulated by BBNJ, which surpass the mandates of existing institutions, including those created by UNCLOS. Nevertheless, CLAM deems important the establishment of a participation mechanism for those bodies, institutions and organizations, in order to assure complementarity and due respect to their competencies. BBNJ should clearly state the faculties of each body and contemplate coordination and cooperation measures with other instruments that may have any connection with the agreement. CLAM also supports the creation of a scientific body that would serve as an advisory entity to the governing body (COP). The establishment of a clearing house mechanism managed by the Secretariat is also desirable. The CHM should promote access to information and transparency through, primarily, an open-access web-based platform. For CLAM, it is important that BBNJ calls for an Assessment Conference of the instrument every five years. Likewise, it should contemplate both mandatory and voluntary funding provisions.\n347\n[PART VII FINANCIAL RESOURCES [AND MECHANISM]]\n348\nARTICLE 52\nIndonesia\nFunding (Article 52) 1.

      "text" : "52(1) There should be a clear link between funding and the benefit sharing provisions, not only capacity building and technology transfer. Payments to a fund based on user fees could be calibrated to facilitate and promote benefit sharing and conservation goals. For example, payments to the fund could be lower for research used to develop and sell ecologically sustainable solutions. This type of incentive mechanism reflects the fact that in innovating in this manner, debts to the ocean and society can be seen as already paid in part.

These aspects can be settled in the respective MGR and EIA sections and art. 52 can only include a catch-all provision to state that payments under this Agreement will be made into the Special Fund.\n52 Alt.1(5bis)(c) The inclusion of Endowments only works if this is a list of voluntary measures. From a drafting perspective it would be preferable to list the various voluntary measures and have a single reference to any mandatory payments agreed to elsewhere under the agreement to be paid into the finance mechanism to be set up.\n52 Alt.1(5bis)(d) The reference to existing financial mechanisms is unclear. As far as the GEF is concerned it would be more appropriate to consider language similar to the CBD Article 21 and Article 39 if a GEF arrangement is to be considered.

Sin embargo, cualesquiera que sean los procedimientos que se incluyan en este artículo, deberán tener en cuenta que de este acuerdo participarán Estados parte y no parte de la CONVEMAR. CLAM sugiere la introducción del siguiente párrafo como artículo 55 bis:\nArtículo 55 Bis. Ninguna acción o actividad que se lleve a cabo en términos de este Acuerdo se entenderá en perjuicio de las posturas de los Estados Partes respecto de una disputa de soberanía ya sea terrestre, insular o marítima o respecto de una disputa relativa a la delimitación de áreas marítimas.\nEs importante que el instrumento garantice que ninguna acción o actividad que se desarrolle en el marco de este instrumento afectará las posiciones de los Estados Partes en relación con alguna disputa de soberanía o de delimitación de las áreas marítimas. Finalmente, CLAM considera que las disposiciones finales no han sido suficientemente discutidas y que su contenido es fundamental para lograr un acuerdo efectivo y eficiente en el cumplimiento de sus objetivos. En ese sentido, solicita a la Presidencia dedicar un espacio suficiente en el plenario y en las sesiones informales, para la discusión de la totalidad de las cláusulas finales. [English version] General statements about final dispositions CLAM supports the inclusion of a dispute settlement clause. Regardless of the content of that clause, it must take into account that this instrument is open to the participation of States parties and non-parties to UNCLOS. CLAM suggests the following paragraph as an introduction to article 55 bis:\nArticle 55 Bis. “No action or activity taken on the basis of the Agreement will be construed or considered to be prejudicial to the positions of States Parties to a land, insular or maritime sovereignty dispute or to a dispute concerning the delimitation of maritime areas”.\n371\nIt is crucial that the instrument guarantees that no action or activity taken within the framework of this agreement will affect the positions of States parties in relation to any sovereignty dispute or delimitation of maritime areas. Furthermore, CLAM suggests the inclusion of an implementation and compliance mechanism in the final dispositions. Such provision could favor the accomplishment of the agreement, enhancing its effectiveness.\nLastly, CLAM believes that the final dispositions have not been sufficiently discussed and that their content is determining for the completion of an effective and efficient agreement, as well as for the fulfilment of its objectives.

While both the LOSC and Convention on Biological Diversity impose obligations for all States to protect the marine environment, LOSC was not envisioned to produce an institutional capacity to expand implementation of Article\n381\n194 further. Article 194 LOSC employs “all measures”, “the measures” and “measures”. The general reference to measures in turns enables States to have a variety of policy options to operationalize Article 194 LOSC in a way that is tailored to their needs, such as: geographic configuration, important marine ecosystems, maritime culture, traditional knowledge, fish stocks, presence of existing and planned activities, sea lanes and coastal communities.

Consideramos que el borrador de Acuerdo BBNJ, a pesar de decir que no aplica a la pesca,\ncontiene disposiciones que se traslapan con las competencias de los Estados ribereños y de\nlas organizaciones internacionales de ordenación pesquera y demás instrumentos\njurídicamente vinculantes en materia pesquera.\n2. Consideramos necesario que se deben respetar las competencias de la FAO como\norganismo internacional competente para los temas de pesca, según se establece en el\nConvenio de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Derecho del Mar (CONVEMAR).\n3. Observamos que el Acuerdo BBNJ contiene términos científicos cuya definición no es\nclara, pero con un alcance y repercusión que afecta a la industria pesquera y libertad de\nnavegación, estimamos que hace falta mayor discusión sobre estos puntos antes de iniciar\nel proceso de toma de decisiones respecto a las mismas.\n4.

We consider that the draft BBNJ Agreement, despite saying that it does not apply to\nfisheries, contains provisions that overlap with the competences of coastal states and\ninternational fisheries management organizations and other legally binding instruments on\nfisheries.\n2. We consider it necessary to respect the competence of the FAO as the competent\ninternational body for fisheries matters, as established in the United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n388\n3. We note that the BBNJ Agreement contains scientific terms whose definition is not clear,\nbut with a scope and repercussion that affects the fishing industry and freedom of\nnavigation, we consider that further discussion is needed on these points before initiating\nthe decision-making process with respect to them.\n4. We request that the text of the BBNJ Agreement contain the obligation to previously\nconsult with the countries, the corresponding fisheries management organizations, and\nother existing authorities, the binding measures that are intended to be adopted in the area\nof fisheries.\n5. We require that the text of the BBNJ Agreement respect the competences already\nestablished and that it neither overlaps nor usurps such competences.\n6. We do not agree with the creation of new governance structures in the international\nframework on fisheries and freedom of navigation matters, because they are regulated and\nbinding.\n7. We support the protection of biological diversity and precisely because of this, we advocate\na framework of respect, cooperation, communication and prior consultation, whenever\nnecessary.\n8. We request an extension of the discussions and negotiations on the subject, because there\nare issues on which there are not yet agreements, requiring more time to study the current\ntext, for the benefit of all parties involved.\n9. We ratify our support for maintaining the axes or areas that are the object of discussion and\nfor maintaining the concepts of common heritage of mankind, transfer of technologies,\nenvironmental impact studies and marine protected areas, within the scope of the\ncompetencies of the bodies, commissions for fisheries management and other existing\ninstitutions."

      "text" : "The global shipping industry has been participating in the discussions for the development of a\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982\n(UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine Biological diversity of areas Beyond\nNational Jurisdiction (BBNJ).\nFollowing three sessions of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in which diverse\nviews have been put forward by governments and observer organisations on the scope of the\n42 Revised draft text of an agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. A/CONF.232/2020/11. Available at: https://www.un.org/bbnj/sites/www.un.org.bbnj/files/revised_draft_text_a.conf_.232.2020.11_advance_unedited_ve rsion.pdf. 43 Note by the secretariat: See also the compilation of textual proposals on Part II. 44 The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) is the principal global trade association for the shipping industry engaged in international trade, representing shipowners and operators in all sectors and trades. Its membership comprises national shipowners’ associations in Asia, Europe and the Americas whose member shipping companies operate over 80% of the world’s merchant tonnage. Its primary role is to represent shipowners with the various international regulatory bodies that impact on shipping, including and most especially the International Maritime Organization and the International Labour Organization. 45 The European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA) is a trade association whose membership comprises the national shipowner associations of the European Union and Norway and whose focus is representation at the EU regulatory institutions. Many of the members of ECSA are also members of the International Chamber of Shipping. 46 The Asian Shipowners’ Association is a trade association whose membership comprises eight national shipowner associations from the Asia-Pacific Region.\n391\nproposed instrument, the international shipping industry welcomes the progress that has been made\ntowards the further protection of the world’s oceans with the publication of a revised draft text in\nNovember 2019. The international shipping industry has carefully reviewed the revised draft text\nand submits the following comments.\nRecalling that almost 90% of international trade is seaborne, it is again emphasised that it\nis imperative for the new instrument to fully respect the rights of navigation and freedom of the\nhigh seas enshrined in articles 87 and 90 of UNCLOS. These principles are essential to the smooth\noperation of shipping and therefore to the safe and efficient delivery of food, energy, vital raw\nmaterials and goods needed to support the world economy and the smooth functioning of society.\nUNCLOS carefully balances the rights and obligations of flag states, coastal states and port\nstates. While UNCLOS provides the basic legal framework for ocean governance, detailed\nregulation of the shipping industry is carried out by member states at the International Maritime\nOrganization (IMO), operating under delegated authority from the UN.\nThe international shipping industry strongly believes that IMO’s global mandate to regulate\nthe international shipping industry on matters that may be the subject of the new agreement\non BBNJ, should be duly recognised in the new agreement.\nThe IMO, which pre-dates UNCLOS, is recognised in UNCLOS as having authority and\ncompetence to make effective regulation for the protection of the marine environment, including\nits biodiversity, from the impacts of international commercial shipping activity including in the\nhigh seas. IMO’s global mandate is shown by provisions in the Convention referring to the\n“competent international organization” – by which is meant IMO – in connection with the adoption\nof international rules and standards in matters concerning maritime safety, efficiency of\nnavigation, and the prevention and control of pollution from vessels and by dumping. IMO’s rules\nand standards are implemented by flag states and enforced globally by port states via port state\ncontrol. This means that a ship is never really beyond national jurisdiction. IMO also upholds a\nprinciple of “no more favourable treatment” by which port states party to a Convention must apply\nit to any ship that voluntarily enters their ports, whether or not the flag state of the ship has ratified\nthat Convention. This ensures that regulations adopted apply to all ships equally and that economic\n392\nadvantage is not gained by those countries that choose not to adopt, ultimately ensuring that\nregulation of ships is effective.\nIn order to successfully achieve its goals, the new agreement must be absolutely clear on\nthe intended relationship between any bodies that it may establish, and relevant legal instruments\nand international bodies. The industry therefore fully supports proposals for the inclusion of legally\nclear provisions on conflict of laws. Clarity is especially important with regard to arrangements\nunder the new instrument for the implementation of Area-Based Management Tools (ABMTs) and\nEnvironmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). With regard to shipping activity, overall competence\nfor designating ABMTs and taking due account of EIAs is vested in the IMO and this responsibility\nshould continue to remain with the IMO. Despite some improvements in this respect, there remain\noptions within the revised draft text of the agreement that could result in conflict or duplication\nwith the mandate of IMO. To avoid this, it should be made clear that this new Agreement will only\nregulate activity that is not within the mandate of another international body or relevant instrument.\nThe new instrument and any new organisation or body that may be established should\ncoordinate and promote coherence and complementarity and not undermine the present\nsystem of ocean governance.\nThe co-sponsors trust that the information above will assist consideration of the draft text of the\nagreement and the discussions at IGC4 and stand ready to provide clarification of any aspects of\nthe position of the shipping industry."

      "text" : "OceanCare Briefing for IGC 4\nProposed Text on Transboundary Pollution for the New Instrument\n6th February 2020\n393\nThis Briefing is intended to support OceanCare’s recommended text on Provisions of the\nPresident’s Draft of the BBNJ Agreement dated November 27, 2019. Please see the respective\ntable on pages 3-7.47\nOceanCare’s position is that UNGA resolution 72/249 is a legal outcome document that\ncharges the IGC with putting into place processes and measures pursuant to UNCLOS and other\ninternational law to achieve the result of the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological\ndiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). This UNGA mandate encompasses all living\nresources that comprise BBNJ and all measures for conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ.\nOceanCare advocates for incorporating provisions for management of transboundary\npollution into the sections of the BBNJ Agreement for environmental impact assessments and\nstrategic environmental assessments, and for area-based management tools, including marine\nprotected areas.\nAlthough the new Agreement will have no legal authority within national jurisdiction,\nresolution 72/249 clearly mandates the inclusive conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ\nwithout reference to the jurisdiction where the risks to BBNJ, including transboundary pollution,\nmay physically originate. Human activities that take place within the jurisdiction of a coastal\nstate may generate transboundary pollution that crosses into the adjacent area beyond\nnational jurisdiction causing significant adverse impacts to BBNJ and vice versa.\nThe BBNJ Agreement should provide robust authority without regard to the\njurisdiction where the transboundary pollution originates or the location of the activity that\ngenerates the transboundary pollution,\n• For assessing all significant adverse impacts to BBNJ due to transboundary pollution, and\n• For considering transboundary pollution in any framework for conservation management\nof BBNJ.\nThe inclusion of the term ‘transboundary pollution’ is relevant insofar as:\n• Transboundary pollution is easily defined and can be readily measured through scientific\ninvestigation, whereas transboundary impact is vague and it may be difficult to establish\ncriteria acceptable to all parties.\n47 Note by the secretariat: Textual proposals from OceanCare are included throughout the various Parts.\n394\n• Transboundary pollution is referred to in an extensive body of existing international law,\nwhereas transboundary impact is not.\n• Transboundary pollution can be addressed and mitigated through practical concrete\nmeasures mandating the reduction of the polluting emissions. Conversely, there is no\npractical way to mitigate transboundary impacts without also addressing the causes at its\nsource.\n• Article 1 of UNCLOS defines marine pollution and can easily be used as a starting point\nto define transboundary pollution that impacts BBNJ.\n• The argument that transboundary pollution is too narrow a category does not stand up to\nscrutiny; transboundary pollution potentially includes a vast assortment of destructive\npollutants—from plastics to chemicals to oil to noise and much more.\nThe Case of Ocean Noise Pollution: A severe transboundary threat to BBNJ\nLevels of ocean noise have doubled every decade for the past 70 years in some regions. Indeed, it\nis now scientifically well-established that both non-impulsive (e.g. commercial shipping) and\nimpulsive noise (e.g. hydrocarbon exploration) can have detrimental effects on many species\nbeyond the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), hence also inflicting significant harm\nto Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ). The General Assembly also\nacknowledged as much when it adopted Resolution 74/19, noting “that ocean noise has potential\nsignificant adverse impacts on living marine resources” (UNGA 74/19: 2019, para. 279). Noise\npollution is particularily alarming considering that a wide variety of species rely on sound for their\nvital life functions, including communication, orientation, prey detection and predator avoidance,\nand for sensing surroundings. In 2017, a study by Australian scientists determined that a single\nseismic airgun had killed all krill larvae and also a large part of the adult zooplankton at a distance\nof 1.2 kilometres in the entire study area48. These findings are particularly worrying as there is\nnow evidence that even the smallest organism suffers from the impact of anthropogenic noise,\npotentially having devastating consequences for the entire marine food web. So far, around 130\nmarine species, practically all exposed to related scientific research, are shown to be impacted by\n48 See McCauley et al.’s “Widely used marine seismic survey air gun operations negatively impact zooplankton” for further findings and explanation.\n395\nunderwater noise, including more than 30 species of marine mammals, around 66 species of fish\nand at least 36 species of invertebrates.\nEvidence furthermore suggests, that noise levels in the ocean present a growing threat to\nfish stocks and the sustainability of fisheries the world over. In this regard, studies have shown\nthat fish catch rates can drop substantially, with larger fish leaving an area coincident with ocean\nnoise events49. By-catch rates have also been observed to increase in the presence of noise whereas\nfish abundance decreases. Across the world, unchecked propagation of ocean noise is now\nundermining efforts to achieve healthy, sustainable oceans and restore fish stocks, with serious\nimplications for human livelihoods and food security50.\nAs the 4th Intergovernmental Conference is rapidly approaching in March 2020,\nOceanCare continues to advocate for managing transboundary pollution and its impact through the\nnew BBNJ Instrument. With this mission in mind, we have taken the opportunity to provide a\nnumber of text-edits that we believe are essential for ensuring a meaningful Instrument in\nconserving biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\n49 See for example Weilgart’s “The Impact Of Ocean Noise Pollution On Fish And Invertebrates” for further reading on the impacts of noise on fish. 50 Other impacts include: body malformations and higher egg or immature mortality; internal injuries, causing disorientation and even death; damage to hearing structures which can worsen over time, temporary hearing loss which can last for months, or even permanent hearing loss; stress, with negative consequences on the immune system and reproductive rates; behavioural changes, including aggression, flight reactions, reduced communication and foraging; high mortality in the presence of noise was suffered by zooplankton."
